</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  program <B>loadkeys</B> reads the file or files specified by
       <I>filename...</I>.  Its main  purpose  is  to  load  the  kernel
       keymap for the console.


</PRE>
<H2>RESET TO DEFAULT</H2><PRE>
       If  the <I>-d</I> (or <I>--default</I> ) option is given, <B>loadkeys</B> loads
       a default keymap, probably the file  <I>defkeymap.map</I>  either
       in          <I>/usr/share/kbd/keymaps</I>          or          in
       <I>/usr/src/linux/drivers/char</I>.   (Probably  the  former  was
       user-defined,  while  the  latter is a qwerty keyboard map
       for PCs - maybe not what was desired.)  Sometimes, with  a
       strange  keymap  loaded  (with  the  minus on some obscure
       unknown modifier combination) it is easier to type  `load­
       keys defkeymap'.


</PRE>
<H2>LOAD KERNEL KEYMAP</H2><PRE>
       The  main  function  of  <B>loadkeys</B> is to load or modify the
       keyboard driver's translation tables.  When specifying the
       file  names, standard input can be denoted by dash (-). If
       no file is specified, the data is read from  the  standard
       input.

       For  many countries and keyboard types appropriate keymaps
       are available already, and a command  like  `loadkeys  uk'
       might  do  what you want. On the other hand, it is easy to
       construct one's own keymap. The user has to tell what sym­
       bols  belong  to  each key. She can find the keycode for a
       key by use of <B>showkey(1)</B>, while the keymap format is given
       in  <B>keymaps(5)</B>  and  can  also  be seen from the output of
       <B>dumpkeys(1)</B>.


</PRE>
<H2>LOAD KERNEL ACCENT TABLE</H2><PRE>
       If the input file does not contain any compose key defini­
       tions,  the  kernel accent table is left unchanged, unless
       the <I>-c</I> (or <I>--clearcompose</I> ) option is given, in which case
       the  kernel  accent  table  is emptied.  If the input file
       does contain compose key definitions, then all old defini­
       tions  are  removed,  and  replaced  by  the specified new
       entries.  The kernel accent table is  a  sequence  of  (by
       default  68) entries describing how dead diacritical signs
       and compose keys behave.  For example, a line

              compose ',' 'c' to ccedilla

       means  that  &lt;ComposeKey&gt;&lt;,&gt;&lt;c&gt;  must   be   combined   to
              string F70 = "Hello!"
              string F71 = "Goodbye!"

       in the keymap.  The default bindings for the function keys
       are certain escape sequences mostly inspired by the  VT100
       terminal.

<H2>CREATE KERNEL SOURCE TABLE</H2><PRE>
       If  the <I>-m</I> (or <I>--mktable</I> ) option is given <B>loadkeys</B> prints
       to the  standard  output  a  file  that  may  be  used  as
       <I>/usr/src/linux/drivers/char/defkeymap.c,</I>   specifying  the
       default key bindings for a kernel (and does not modify the
       current keymap).


</PRE>
<H2>OTHER OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-h</B> <B>--help</B>
              <B>loadkeys</B>  prints  its  version  number  and a short
              usage message to the programs standard error output
              and exits.


</PRE>
<H2>WARNING</H2><PRE>
       Note  that  anyone  having read access to <B>/dev/console</B> can
       run <B>loadkeys</B> and thus change the keyboard layout, possibly
       making  it  unusable.  Note  that the keyboard translation
       table is common for  all  the  virtual  consoles,  so  any
       changes  to  the  keyboard bindings affect all the virtual
       consoles simultaneously.

       Note that because the changes affect all the virtual  con­
       soles,  they  also  outlive  your session. This means that
       even at the login prompt the key bindings may not be  what
       the user expects.
