<h1 class="Head">Condition / Expression Property of R Breakpoints</h1>

<p>Each breakpoint can have a unique condition that determines if the will be suspended at the
breakpoint position. A conditional breakpoint has a question mark overlay on its icon.</p>
	
<p>A condition for a breakpoint can be any valid R expression.  The expression is evaluated in the 
scope (R frame) of the breakpoint location.  If it evaluates to an atomic R logical value 
<code>TRUE</code>, the thread is suspended as usual.  Otherwise it is skipped like a disabled 
breakpoint.</p>

<h4>Changing the Settings</h4>

<p>A condition can be set, enabled/disabled and removed in the Breakpoint view.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select the breakpoint to change.<br/>
	The Breakpoint view shows properties supported by the selected breakpoint in the 
	detail pane below or beside the breakpoints list.
	</li>
	<li>The checkbox <span class="uisequence">Conditional / Expression</span> allows to enable and 
	disable the condition.
	</li>
	<li>If the checkbox is enabled, the user can enter the expression of the condition in the 
	text field below.  The common Save command (<span class="uisequence">File &gt; Save</span>) 
	applies the changed expression to the breakpoint; it is also automatically saved when 
	selecting another breakpoint.
	</li>
</ol>
