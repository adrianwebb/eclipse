<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>lpstat</B>  displays  status  information  about  the  current
       classes,  jobs,  and printers. When run with no arguments,
       <B>lpstat</B> will list jobs queued by the  user.  Other  options
       include:

       -E
            Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -a [<I>printer(s)</I>]
            Shows  the  accepting  state of printer queues. If no
            printers are specified then all printers are  listed.

       -c [<I>class(es)</I>]
            Shows  the  printer  classes  and  the  printers that
            belong to them. If no classes are specified then  all
            classes are listed.

       -d
            Shows the current default destination.

       -h <I>server</I>
            Specifies the CUPS server to communicate with.

       -l
            Shows a long listing of printers, classes, or jobs.

       -o [<I>destination(s)</I>]
            Shows  the  jobs queue on the specified destinations.
            If no destinations are specified all jobs are  shown.

       -p [<I>printer(s)</I>]
            Shows  the  printers  and  whether  or  not  they are
            enabled for printing. If no  printers  are  specified
            then all printers are listed.

       -r
            Shows whether or not the CUPS server is running.

       -R
            Shows the ranking of print jobs.

       -s
            Shows  a status summary, including the default desti­
            nation, a list of classes and their member  printers,
            and  a list of printers and their associated devices.
            Shows  the printers and what device they are attached
            to. If no printers are specified  then  all  printers
            are listed.

       -W [<I>which-jobs</I>]
            Specifies  which  jobs to show, <I>completed</I> or <I>not-com­</I>
            <I>pleted</I> (the default).

<H2>COMPATIBILITY</H2><PRE>
       Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS  allows  printer
       names  to contain any printable character except SPACE and
       TAB. Also, printer and class names are <B>not</B> case-sensitive.

       The "-h" option is not a standard System V option.

       The  Solaris  "-f",  "-P",  and  "-S" options are silently
       ignored.

       The "-W" option is unique to CUPS.
