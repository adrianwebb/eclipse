<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>captoinfo</B> [<B>-v</B><I>n</I> <I>width</I>]  [<B>-V</B>] [<B>-1</B>] [<B>-w</B> <I>width</I>] <I>file</I> . . .

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>captoinfo</B> looks in <I>file</I>  for  <B>termcap</B>  descriptions.   For
       each  one  found,  an  equivalent  <B>terminfo</B> description is
       written to standard output.  Termcap <B>tc</B>  capabilities  are
       translated directly to terminfo <B>use</B> capabilities.

       If no <I>file</I> is given, then the environment variable <B>TERMCAP</B>
       is used for the filename or entry.  If <B>TERMCAP</B> is  a  full
       pathname to a file, only the terminal whose name is speci­
       fied in the environment variable <B>TERM</B>  is  extracted  from
       that  file.   If  the  environment variable <B>TERMCAP</B> is not
       set, then the file <B>/usr/share/terminfo</B> is read.

       <B>-v</B>   print out tracing information on  standard  error  as
            the program runs.

       <B>-V</B>   print  out the version of the program in use on stan­
            dard error and exit.

       <B>-1</B>   cause the fields to print out one to a line.   Other­
            wise, the fields will be printed several to a line to
            a maximum width of 60 characters.

       <B>-w</B>   change the output to <I>width</I> characters.

<H2>TRANSLATIONS FROM NONSTANDARD CAPABILITIES</H2><PRE>
       Some  obsolete nonstandard capabilities will automatically
       be translated into  standard  (SVr4/XSI  Curses)  terminfo
       capabilities  by  <B>captoinfo</B>.   Whenever one of these auto­
       matic translations is done,  the  program  will  issue  an
       notification to stderr, inviting the user to check that it
       has not mistakenly translated  a  completely  unknown  and
       random capability and/or syntax error.

       XENIX  termcap  also used to have a set of extension capa­
       bilities for forms drawing, designed to take advantage  of
       the IBM PC high-half graphics.  They were as follows:

       If  the  single-line  capabilities occur in an entry, they
       will automatically be composed into an <B>acsc</B>  string.   The
       double-line capabilities and <B>GG</B> are discarded with a warn­
       ing message.

       IBM's AIX has a terminfo facility descended from SVr1 ter­
       minfo but incompatible with the SVr4 format. The following
       AIX extensions are automatically translated:

       This utility is actually a link to <B>tic(1M)</B>, running in  <I>-I</I>
       mode.  You can use other <I>tic</I> options such as <B>-f</B> and  <B>-x</B>.

       The  trace  option isn't identical to SVr4's.  Under SVr4,
       instead of following the -v with  a  trace  level  n,  you
       repeat it n times.
