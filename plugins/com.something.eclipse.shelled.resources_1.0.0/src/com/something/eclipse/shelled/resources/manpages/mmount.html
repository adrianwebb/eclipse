<H2>Note of warning</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation, and may  not  be  entirely
       accurate  or  complete.   See the end of this man page for
       details.

<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       The mmount command is used to mount an MS-DOS disk. It  is
       only  available  on  Linux, as it is only useful if the OS
       kernel allows to configure the disk geometry.  Its  syntax
       is:

       mmount <I>msdosdrive</I> [<I>mountargs</I>]

       Mmount reads the boot sector of an MS-DOS disk, configures
       the drive geometry, and finally mounts  it  passing  moun­
       targs  to mount.  If no mount arguments are specified, the
       name of the device is used. If  the  disk  is  write  pro­
       tected, it is automatically mounted read only.

<H2>Viewing the texi doc</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this  process  is
       only  approximative,  and  some items, such as crossrefer­
       ences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  translation
       process.   Indeed,  these items have no appropriate repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I strongly advise you to use  the  original  texinfo  doc.
       See  the  end of this manpage for instructions how to view
       the texinfo doc.
