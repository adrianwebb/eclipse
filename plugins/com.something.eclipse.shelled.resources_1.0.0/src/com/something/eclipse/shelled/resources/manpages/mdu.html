<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       Mdu is used to list the space occupied by a directory, its
       subdirectories and its files. It is similar to the du com­
       mand  on Unix.  The unit used are clusters.  Use the minfo
       command to find out the cluster size.

              vidual files.

<H2>Viewing the texi doc</H2><PRE>
       This  manpage  has  been  automatically   generated   from
       mtools's  texinfo  documentation. However, this process is
       only approximative, and some items,  such  as  crossrefer­
       ences,  footnotes and indices are lost in this translation
       process.  Indeed, these items have no  appropriate  repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I  strongly  advise  you  to use the original texinfo doc.
       See the end of this manpage for instructions how  to  view
       the texinfo doc.
