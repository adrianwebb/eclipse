<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>dig</B> (domain information groper) is  a  flexible  tool  for
       interrogating  DNS  name  servers. It performs DNS lookups
       and displays the answers that are returned from  the  name
       server(s)  that  were queried. Most DNS administrators use
       <B>dig</B> to troubleshoot DNS problems because of its  flexibil­
       ity, ease of use and clarity of output. Other lookup tools
       tend to have less functionality than <B>dig</B>.

       Although <B>dig</B> is normally used with command-line arguments,
       it  also  has a batch mode of operation for reading lookup
       requests from a file. A brief summary of its  command-line
       arguments  and  options  is  printed when the <B>-h</B> option is
       given.  Unlike earlier versions, the BIND9  implementation
       of  <B>dig</B> allows multiple lookups to be issued from the com­
       mand line.

       Unless it is told to query a  specific  name  server,  <B>dig</B>
       will try each of the servers listed in <I>/etc/resolv.conf</I>.

       When  no command line arguments or options are given, will
       perform an NS query for "." (the root).


</PRE>
<H2>SIMPLE USAGE</H2><PRE>
       A typical invocation of <B>dig</B> looks like:

        dig @server name type

       where:

       <B>server</B> is the name or IP address of  the  name  server  to
              query.  This can be an IPv4 address in dotted-deci­
              mal notation or an IPv6 address in  colon-delimited
              notation.  When  the  supplied <I>server</I> argument is a
              hostname, <B>dig</B> resolves that  name  before  querying
              that  name  server.  If  no <I>server</I> argument is pro­
              vided, <B>dig</B> consults  <I>/etc/resolv.conf</I>  and  queries
              the  name  servers listed there. The reply from the
              name server that responds is displayed.

       <B>name</B>   is the name of the resource record that  is  to  be
              looked up.

       The <B>-f</B> option makes <B>dig</B>  operate in batch mode by  reading
       a  list  of lookup requests to process from the file <I>file­</I>
       <I>name</I>. The file contains a number of queries, one per line.
       Each entry in the file should be organised in the same way
       they would be presented as queries to <B>dig</B> using  the  com­
       mand-line interface.

       If  a  non-standard  port  number is to be queried, the <B>-p</B>
       option is used. <I>port#</I> is the port  number  that  <B>dig</B>  will
       send  its  queries instead of the standard DNS port number
       53. This option would be used to test a name  server  that
       has  been  configured to listen for queries on a non-stan­
       dard port number.

       The <B>-t</B> option sets the query type to <I>type</I>. It can  be  any
       valid  query type which is supported in BIND9. The default
       query type "A", unless the <B>-x</B> option is supplied to  indi­
       cate  a  reverse lookup.  A zone transfer can be requested
       by specifying a type of AXFR.  When  an  incremental  zone
       transfer  (IXFR)  is required, <I>type</I> is set to ixfr=N.  The
       incremental zone transfer will contain the changes made to
       the  zone since the serial number in the zone's SOA record
       was <I>N</I>.

       Reverse lookups - mapping addresses to names - are simpli­
       fied  by the <B>-x</B> option. <I>addr</I> is an IPv4 address in dotted-
       decimal notation, or a colon-delimited IPv6 address.  When
       this option is used, there is no need to provide the <I>name</I>,
       <I>class</I> and <I>type</I> arguments.  <B>dig</B>  automatically  performs  a
       lookup  for  a name like 11.12.13.10.in-addr.arpa and sets
       the query type and class to PTR and  IN  respectively.  By
       default,  IPv6  addresses are looked up using the IP6.ARPA
       domain and binary labels as defined in RFC2874. To use the
       older RFC1886 method using the IP6.INT domain and "nibble"
       labels, specify the <B>-n</B> (nibble) option.

       To sign the DNS queries sent by <B>dig</B>  and  their  responses
       using  transaction  signatures  (TSIG), specify a TSIG key
       file using the <B>-k</B> option. You can also  specify  the  TSIG
       key  itself  on the command line using the <B>-y</B> option; <I>name</I>
       is the name of the TSIG key and <I>key</I> is the actual key. The
       key  is  a  base-64 encoded string, typically generated by
       <B>dnssec-keygen(8)</B>.  Caution should be taken when using  the
       <B>-y</B>  option on multi-user systems as the key can be visible
       in the output from <B>ps(1)</B> or in the shell's  history  file.
       When  using  TSIG authentication with <B>dig</B>, the name server
       that is queried needs to know the key and  algorithm  that
       is  being  used. In BIND, this is done by providing appro­
       priate <B>key</B> and <B>server</B> statements in <I>named.conf</I>.


</PRE>
<H2>QUERY OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
              Use  [do  not  use] TCP when querying name servers.
              The default behaviour is to use UDP unless an  AXFR
              or  IXFR  query  is  requested, in which case a TCP
              connection is used.

       <B>+[no]vc</B>
              Use [do not use] TCP when  querying  name  servers.
              This  alternate  syntax to <I>+[no]tcp</I> is provided for
              backwards compatibility. The "vc" stands for  "vir­
              tual circuit".

       <B>+[no]ignore</B>
              Ignore  truncation  in  UDP  responses  instead  of
              retrying with TCP. By default, TCP retries are per­
              formed.

       <B>+domain=somename</B>
              Set  the  search  list to contain the single domain
              <I>somename</I>, as if specified in a <B>domain</B> directive  in
              <I>/etc/resolv.conf</I>, and enable search list processing
              as if the <I>+search</I> option were given.

       <B>+[no]search</B>
              Use [do not use] the search  list  defined  by  the
              searchlist  or  domain directive in <I>resolv.conf</I> (if
              any).  The search list is not used by default.

       <B>+[no]defname</B>
              Deprecated, treated as a synonym for <I>+[no]search</I>

       <B>+[no]aaonly</B>
              This option does nothing. It is provided  for  com­
              patibility with old versions of <B>dig</B> where it set an
              unimplemented resolver flag.

       <B>+[no]adflag</B>
              Set [do not set] the AD (authentic data) bit in the
              query.  The AD bit currently has a standard meaning
              only in responses, not in queries, but the  ability
              to  set  the  bit in the query is provided for com­
              pleteness.

       <B>+[no]cdflag</B>
              Set [do not set] the CD (checking disabled) bit  in
              the  query. This requests the server to not perform
              DNSSEC validation of responses.

       <B>+[no]recursive</B>
              Toggle the setting of the  RD  (recursion  desired)
              bit  in  the  query.   This  bit is set by default,
              which means <B>dig</B> normally sends  recursive  queries.
              Recursion   is   automatically  disabled  when  the
              root servers, showing the answer from  each  server
              that was used to resolve the lookup.

       <B>+[no]cmd</B>
              toggles  the printing of the initial comment in the
              output identifying the version of <B>dig</B> and the query
              options  that  have  been  applied. This comment is
              printed by default.

       <B>+[no]short</B>
              Provide a terse answer. The default is to print the
              answer in a verbose form.

       <B>+[no]identify</B>
              Show  [or do not show] the IP address and port num­
              ber that supplied the answer when the <I>+short</I> option
              is  enabled.  If  short form answers are requested,
              the default is not to show the source  address  and
              port number of the server that provided the answer.

       <B>+[no]comments</B>
              Toggle the display of comment lines in the  output.
              The default is to print comments.

       <B>+[no]stats</B>
              This  query  option toggles the printing of statis­
              tics: when the query was  made,  the  size  of  the
              reply  and so on. The default behaviour is to print
              the query statistics.

       <B>+[no]qr</B>
              Print [do not print] the query as it is  sent.   By
              default, the query is not printed.

       <B>+[no]question</B>
              Print  [do  not  print]  the  question section of a
              query when an answer is returned. The default is to
              print the question section as a comment.

       <B>+[no]answer</B>
              Display  [do  not  display] the answer section of a
              reply. The default is to display it.

       <B>+[no]authority</B>
              Display [do not display] the authority section of a
              reply. The default is to display it.

       <B>+[no]additional</B>
              Display  [do not display] the additional section of
              a reply.  The default is to display it.

       <B>+[no]all</B>
       <B>+ndots=D</B>
              Set the number of dots that have to appear in  <I>name</I>
              to  <I>D</I> for it to be considered absolute. The default
              value is that defined using the ndots statement  in
              <I>/etc/resolv.conf</I>,  or  1  if  no ndots statement is
              present. Names with fewer dots are  interpreted  as
              relative  names  and  will  be  searched for in the
              domains listed in the <B>search</B> or <B>domain</B> directive in
              <I>/etc/resolv.conf</I>.

       <B>+bufsize=B</B>
              Set  the  UDP  message buffer size advertised using
              EDNS0 to <I>B</I> bytes. The maximum and minimum sizes  of
              this  buffer  are  65535 and 0 respectively. Values
              outside this range are rounded up or down appropri­
              ately.

       <B>+[no]multiline</B>
              Print  records  like  the  SOA records in a verbose
              multi-line format with human-readable comments. The
              default  is  to print each record on a single line,
              to facilitate machine parsing of the <B>dig</B> output.

       <B>+[no]fail</B>
              Do not try the next server if you receive  a  SERV­
              FAIL.  The  default  is  to not try the next server
              which  is  the  reverse  of  normal  stub  resolver
              behaviour.

       <B>+[no]besteffort</B>
              Attempt  to  display the contents of messages which
              are malformed.  The default is to not display  mal­
              formed answers.

       <B>+[no]dnssec</B>
              Requests  DNSSEC  records  be  sent  by setting the
              DNSSEC OK bit (DO) in the the  OPT  record  in  the
              additional section of the query.


</PRE>
<H2>MULTIPLE QUERIES</H2><PRE>
       The BIND 9 implementation of <B>dig</B>  supports specifying mul­
       tiple queries on the command line (in addition to support­
       ing  the  <B>-f</B> batch file option). Each of those queries can
       be supplied with its own set of flags, options  and  query
       options.

       In  this case, each <I>query</I> argument represent an individual
       query in the command-line  syntax  described  above.  Each
       consists  of  any  of  the standard options and flags, the
       name to be looked up, an optional query type and class and
       any query options that should be applied to that query.

       <B>dig</B>  shows  the initial query it made for each lookup. The
       final query has a local query option of <I>+noqr</I> which  means
       that <B>dig</B> will not print the initial query when it looks up
       the NS records for isc.org.
