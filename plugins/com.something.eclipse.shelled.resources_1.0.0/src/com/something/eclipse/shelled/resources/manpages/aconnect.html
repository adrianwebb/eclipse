       <B>aconnect</B> [-d] [-options] sender receiver

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>aconnect</B> is a utility to connect and disconnect two exist­
       ing ports on ALSA sequencer system.  The  ports  with  the
       arbitrary subscription permission, such as created by <B>ase­</B>
       <B>qview(1),</B> can be connected  to  any  (MIDI)  device  ports
       using <B>aconnect.</B>  For example, to connect from port 64:0 to
       65:0, run as follows:

           % aconnect 64:0 65:0

       The connection is one-way,  and  the  whole  data  to  the
       sender  port  (64:0)  is  redirected  to the receiver port
       (65:0).  When another port (e.g. 65:1) is attached to  the
       same sender port, the data is sent to both receiver ports.
       For disconnection, use <B>-d</B> option.

           % aconnect -d 64:0 65:0

       The address can be given using the client's name.

           % aconnect External:0 Emu8000:1

       Then the port 0 of the client  matching  with  the  string
       "External" is connected to the port 1 of the client match­
       ing with the "Emu8000".

       Another function of <B>aconnect</B> is to list the present  ports
       on the given condition.  The input ports, which may become
       <I>sender</I> ports, can be listed with <B>-i</B> option.

           % aconnect -i
           client 0: 'System' [type=kernel]
               0 'Timer           '
               1 'Announce        '
           client 64: 'External MIDI-0' [type=kernel]
               0 'MIDI 0-0        '

       Similary, to see the output ports, use <B>-o</B> flag.

       You can remove all existing exported connections using  <B>-x</B>
       option.   This function is useful for terminating the ALSA
       drivers, because the modules  with  sequencer  connections
       cannot be unloaded unless their connections are removed.


              must use (not necessarily own) the specified queue.

       <B>-t,</B> <B>--tick</B> <B>queue</B>
              Like  <B>-r</B>  option,  but time-stamps are converted to
              the current value of the given <I>tick</I> queue.


   <B>LIST</B> <B>PORTS</B>
       <B>-i,</B> <B>--input</B>
              List existing input (readable) ports.  This  option
              is exclusive to <B>-o.</B>

       <B>-o,</B> <B>--output</B>
              List existing output (writable) ports.  This option
              is exclusive to <B>-i.</B>

       <B>-l,</B> <B>--list</B>
              List the current connection status.  The  connected
              and  connecting  ports from/to each port are listed
              together.  The suffix flag <B>[ex]</B> means  the  connec­
              tion  is  exclusive.   The suffix flag <B>[real:#]</B> and
              <B>[tick:#]</B> mean the connection includes real-time and
              tick  conversion on the listed queue, respectively.


   <B>REMOVE</B> <B>ALL</B> <B>CONNECTIONS</B>
       <B>-x,</B> <B>--removeall</B>
              Remove all exported connections.
