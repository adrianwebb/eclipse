<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>mkisofs</B> is effectively a pre-mastering program to generate
       an ISO9660/JOLIET/HFS hybrid filesystem.

       <B>mkisofs</B> is capable of generating the  <B>System</B>  <B>Use</B>  <B>Sharing</B>
       <B>Protocol</B> <B>records</B> <B>(SUSP)</B> specified by the <B>Rock</B> <B>Ridge</B> <B>Inter­</B>
       <B>change</B> <B>Protocol.</B>  This is used  to  further  describe  the
       files  in  the iso9660 filesystem to a unix host, and pro­
       vides information such as longer filenames, uid/gid, posix
       permissions,  symbolic links, block and character devices.

       If Joliet or HFS hybrid command line  options  are  speci­
       fied,  <B>mkisofs</B> will create additional filesystem meta data
       for Joliet or HFS.  The file content in this  case  refers
       to  the same data blocks on the media.  It will generate a
       pure ISO9660 filesystem unless the Joliet  or  HFS  hybrid
       command line options are given.

       <B>mkisofs</B>  can  generate  a  <I>true</I>  (or  <I>shared</I>)  HFS  hybrid
       filesystem. The same files are  seen  as  HFS  files  when
       accessed  from  a  Macintosh  and  as  ISO9660  files when
       accessed from other machines. HFS stands for  <I>Hierarchical</I>
       <I>File</I>  <I>System</I>  and is the native file system used on Macin­
       tosh computers.

       As an alternative, <B>mkisofs</B> can generate the  <I>Apple</I>  <I>Exten­</I>
       <I>sions</I>  <I>to</I>  <I>ISO9660</I> for each file. These extensions provide
       each file with CREATOR, TYPE and certain Finder Flags when
       accessed from a Macintosh. See the <B>HFS</B> <B>MACINTOSH</B> <B>FILE</B> <B>FOR­</B>
       <B>MATS</B> section below.

       <B>mkisofs</B> takes a snapshot of a given  directory  tree,  and
       generates  a  binary  image  which  will  correspond to an
       ISO9660 or HFS filesystem when written to a block  device.

       Each  file  written  to the iso9660 filesystem must have a
       filename in the 8.3 format (8 characters, period, 3  char­
       acters,  all  upper  case),  even if Rock Ridge is in use.
       This filename is used on systems that are not able to make
       use  of  the  Rock  Ridge extensions (such as MS-DOS), and
       each filename in each directory must be different from the
       other  filenames in the same directory.  <B>mkisofs</B> generally
       tries to form correct names by forcing the  unix  filename
       to  upper case and truncating as required, but often times
       this yields unsatisfactory results when  there  are  cases
       where  the  truncated  names  are not all unique.  <B>mkisofs</B>
       assigns weightings to each filename, and if two names that
       Note  that <B>mkisofs</B> is not designed to communicate with the
       writer directly.  Most writers  have  proprietary  command
       sets  which vary from one manufacturer to another, and you
       need a specialized tool to actually burn the disk.

       The <B>cdrecord</B> utility is a utility capable  of  burning  an
       actual  disc.  The latest version of <B>cdrecord</B> is available
       from ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/cdrecord

       Also you should know that most cd writers are very partic­
       ular  about  timing.   Once  you start to burn a disc, you
       cannot let their buffer empty before you are done, or  you
       will end up with a corrupt disc.  Thus it is critical that
       you be able to maintain an uninterrupted  data  stream  to
       the  writer  for  the  entire  time that the disc is being
       written.

       <B>pathspec</B> is the path of the directory tree  to  be  copied
       into the iso9660 filesystem.  Multiple paths can be speci­
       fied, and <B>mkisofs</B> will merge the files found in all of the
       specified path components to form the cdrom image.

       If the option <I>-graft-points</I> has been specified, it is pos­
       sible to graft the paths at points  other  than  the  root
       directory,  and  it is possible to graft files or directo­
       ries onto the cdrom image with names different  than  what
       they  have  in  the source filesystem.  This is easiest to
       illustrate with a couple of  examples.    Let's  start  by
       assuming that a local file ../old.lis exists, and you wish
       to include it in the cdrom image.


            foo/bar/=../old.lis

       will include the  file  old.lis  in  the  cdrom  image  at
       /foo/bar/old.lis, while

            foo/bar/xxx=../old.lis

       will  include  the  file  old.lis  in  the  cdrom image at
       /foo/bar/xxx.  The same sort of syntax can  be  used  with
       directories  as well.  <B>mkisofs</B> will create any directories
       required such that the graft points  exist  on  the  cdrom
       image  -  the  directories do not need to appear in one of
       the paths.  By default, any directories that  are  created
       on the fly like this will have permissions 0555 and appear
       to be owned by the person running mkisofs.   If  you  wish
       other  permissions  or owners of the intermediate directo­
       ries, see -uid, -gid, -dir-mode, -file-mode and  -new-dir-
       mode.

       <B>mkisofs</B>  will also run on Win9X/NT4 machines when compiled
              the volume header.  This should describe the appli­
              cation that will be on the disc.  There is space on
              the disc for 128 characters of  information.   This
              parameter  can  also  be set in the file <B>.mkisofsrc</B>
              with APPI=id.  If specified  in  both  places,  the
              command line version is used.

       <B>-allow-lowercase</B>
              This options allows lower case characters to appear
              in iso9660 filenames.
              This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it  happens
              to work on some systems.  Use with caution.

       <B>-allow-multidot</B>
              This  options allows more than one dot to appear in
              iso9660 filenames.  A leading dot is  not  affected
              by  this option, it may be allowed separately using
              the <B>-L</B> option.
              This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it  happens
              to work on many systems.  Use with caution.

       <B>-biblio</B> <I>FILE</I>
              Specifies the bibliographic file name.  This param­
              eter can also be set in the  file  <B>.mkisofsrc</B>  with
              BIBLO=filename.   If  specified in both places, the
              command line version is used.

       <B>-cache-inodes</B>
              Cache inode and device numbers to find  hard  links
              to  files.   If  <B>mkisofs</B>  finds a hard link (a file
              with multiple  names),  then  the  file  will  only
              appear  once on the CD. This helps to save space on
              the CD.  The option  <B>-cache-inodes</B>  is  default  on
              UNIX like operating systems.  Be careful when using
              this option on a filesystem  without  unique  inode
              numbers  as  it  may result in files containing the
              wrong content on CD.

       <B>-no-cache-inodes</B>
              Do not cache inode and device numbers.  This option
              is  needed  whenever  a  filesystem  does  not have
              unique inode numbers. It is the default on  <B>Cygwin</B>.
              As  the  Microsoft operating system that runs below
              <B>Cygwin</B> is not POSIX compliant,  it  does  not  have
              unique  inode  numbers.   Cygwin creates fake inode
              numbers from a hash algorithm that is not 100% cor­
              rect.   If <B>mkisofs</B> would cache inodes on Cygwin, it
              would  believe  that  some  files   are   identical
              although  they are not. The result in this case are
              files that contain the wrong content if a  signifi­
              cant  amount  of  different  files  (&gt; ~5000) is in
              inside the tree that is to be archived.  This  does
              assumed that the first 512 byte  sector  should  be
              read from the boot image (it is essentially emulat­
              ing a normal floppy drive).  This  will  work,  for
              example,  if  the  boot  image is a LILO based boot
              floppy.

              If the boot image is not an image of a floppy,  you
              need  to add one of the options: <B>-hard-disk-boot</B> or
              <B>-no-emul-boot</B>.  If the system should not  boot  off
              the emulated disk, use <B>-no-boot</B>.

       <B>-eltorito-alt-boot</B>
              Start  with  a  new set of "El Torito" boot parame­
              ters.  This allows to have more than one El  Torito
              boot  on  a  CD.   A  maximum  of 63 El Torito boot
              entries may be put on a single CD.

       <B>-B</B> <I>img</I><B>_</B><I>sun4,img</I><B>_</B><I>sun4c,img</I><B>_</B><I>sun4m,img</I><B>_</B><I>sun4d,img</I><B>_</B><I>sun4e</I>
              Specifies a comma separated  list  of  boot  images
              that  are  needed  to  make a bootable CD for sparc
              systems.  There may be empty fields  in  the  comma
              separated  list.  This option is required to make a
              bootable CD for Sun sparc systems.  If  the  <B>-B</B>  or
              <B>-sparc-boot</B>  option  has  been specified, the first
              sector of the resulting image will  contain  a  Sun
              disk  label.  This disk label specifies slice 0 for
              the iso9660 image and slice 1 ... slice 7  for  the
              boot  images  that  have  been  specified with this
              option. Byte offset 512 ... 8191 within each of the
              additional  boot images must contain a primary boot
              that works for the appropriate sparc  architecture.
              The  rest of each of the images usually contains an
              ufs filesystem that is  used  primary  kernel  boot
              stage.

              The  implemented  boot  method  is  the boot method
              found with SunOS 4.x and SunOS  5.x.   However,  it
              does  not  depend  on  SunOS  internals but only on
              properties of the Open Boot prom. For this  reason,
              it  should  be  usable  for any OS that boots off a
              sparc system.

              If the special filename <B>...</B>  is  used,  the  actual
              and all following boot partitions are mapped to the
              previous partition. If <B>mkisofs</B> is  called  with  <B>-G</B>
              <I>image</I> <B>-B</B> <I>...</I>  all boot partitions are mapped to the
              partition  that  contains  the  iso9660  filesystem
              image and the generic boot image that is located in
              the first 16 sectors of the disk is  used  for  all
              architectures.

       <B>-G</B> <I>generic</I><B>_</B><I>boot</I><B>_</B><I>image</I>
              that contains a single partition.

       <B>-no-emul-boot</B>
              Specifies that the boot image used  to  create  "El
              Torito" bootable CDs is a 'no emulation' image. The
              system will load and  execute  this  image  without
              performing any disk emulation.

       <B>-no-boot</B>
              Specifies that the created "El Torito" CD should be
              marked as not bootable. The system will provide  an
              emulated  drive  for the image, but will boot off a
              standard boot device.

       <B>-boot-load-seg</B> <I>segment</I><B>_</B><I>address</I>
              Specifies the load  segment  address  of  the  boot
              image for no-emulation "El Torito" CDs.

       <B>-boot-load-size</B> <I>load</I><B>_</B><I>sectors</I>
              Specifies  the  number of "virtual" (512-byte) sec­
              tors to load in no-emulation mode.  The default  is
              to load the entire boot file.  Some BIOSes may have
              problems if this is not a multiple of 4.

       <B>-boot-info-table</B>
              Specifies that a 56-byte table with information  of
              the CD-ROM layout will be patched in at offset 8 in
              the boot file.  If this option is given,  the  boot
              file  is modified in the source filesystem, so make
              sure to make a copy if this file cannot  be  easily
              regenerated!   See  the  <B>EL</B>  <B>TORITO</B> <B>BOOT</B> <B>INFO</B> <B>TABLE</B>
              section for a description of this table.

       <B>-C</B> <I>last</I><B>_</B><I>sess</I><B>_</B><I>start,next</I><B>_</B><I>sess</I><B>_</B><I>start</I>
              This option is needed when <B>mkisofs</B> is used to  cre­
              ate a CDextra or the image of a second session or a
              higher level session for a multi session disk.  The
              option  <B>-C</B> takes a pair of two numbers separated by
              a comma. The first number is the sector  number  of
              the  first  sector  in the last session of the disk
              that should be appended to.  The second  number  is
              the starting sector number of the new session.  The
              expected pair of numbers may be retrieved by  call­
              ing  <B>cdrecord</B> <B>-msinfo</B> <B>...</B>  If the <B>-C</B> option is used
              in conjunction with the  <B>-M</B>  option,  <B>mkisofs</B>  will
              create  a filesystem image that is intended to be a
              continuation of the previous session.   If  the  <B>-C</B>
              option  is used without the <B>-M</B> option, <B>mkisofs</B> will
              create a filesystem image that is  intended  to  be
              used  for  a second session on a CDextra. This is a
              multi session CD that holds audio data in the first
              session and a ISO9660 filesystem in the second ses­

       <B>-check-oldnames</B>
              Check  all  filenames imported from old session for
              compliance with actual <B>mkisofs</B> iso9660 file  naming
              rules.   It  his  option is not present, only names
              with a length &gt; 31 are checked as these files are a
              hard violation of the iso9660 standard.

       <B>-check-session</B> <I>FILE</I>
              Check  all  old sessions for compliance with actual
              <B>mkisofs</B> iso9660 file naming rules.  This is a  high
              level  option that is a combination of the options:
              <B>-M</B> <I>FILE</I> <B>-C</B> <B>0,0</B> <B>-check-oldnames</B>  For  the  parameter
              <I>FILE</I> see description of <B>-M</B> option.

       <B>-copyright</B> <I>FILE</I>
              Specifies  the Copyright file name.  This parameter
              can  also  be  set  in  the  file  <B>.mkisofsrc</B>  with
              COPY=filename.   If  specified  in both places, the
              command line version is used.

       <B>-d</B>     Omit trailing period from files that do not have  a
              period.
              This  violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens
              to work on many systems.  Use with caution.

       <B>-D</B>     Do not use deep directory relocation,  and  instead
              just pack them in the way we see them.
              This  violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens
              to work on many systems.  Use with caution.

       <B>-dir-mode</B> <I>mode</I>
              Overrides the mode of directories  used  to  create
              the image to <I>mode</I>.  Specifying this option automat­
              ically enables Rock Ridge extensions.

       <B>-dvd-video</B>
              Generate DVD-Video compliant UDF file system.  This
              is  done by sorting the order of the content of the
              appropriate files and by adding padding between the
              files if needed.

       <B>-f</B>     Follow  symbolic links when generating the filesys­
              tem.  When this option  is  not  in  use,  symbolic
              links  will be entered using Rock Ridge if enabled,
              otherwise the file will be ignored.

       <B>-file-mode</B> <I>mode</I>
              Overrides the mode of regular files used to  create
              the image to <I>mode</I>.  Specifying this option automat­
              ically enables Rock Ridge extensions.

       <B>-gid</B> <I>gid</I>
              <I>points</I> has been specified.

       <B>-hide</B> <I>glob</I>
              Hide  <I>glob</I>  from  being seen on the ISO9660 or Rock
              Ridge directory.  <I>glob</I> is a  shell  wild-card-style
              pattern that must match any part of the filename or
              path.  Multiple  globs  may  be  hidden.   If  <I>glob</I>
              matches  a  directory,  then  the  contents of that
              directory will be hidden.   In  order  to  match  a
              directory  name,  make  sure  the pathname does not
              include a trailing '/' character.  All  the  hidden
              files  will still be written to the output CD image
              file.  Should be used with the <B>-hide-joliet</B> option.
              See README.hide for more details.

       <B>-hide-list</B> <I>file</I>
              A  file  containing a list of <I>globs</I> to be hidden as
              above.

       <B>-hidden</B> <I>glob</I>
              Add  the  hidden  (existence)   ISO9660   directory
              attribute  for  <I>glob</I>.   This attribute will prevent
              <I>glob</I> from being listed on DOS based systems if  the
              /A  flag  is  not  used for the listing.  <I>glob</I> is a
              shell wild-card-style pattern that must  match  any
              part  of the filename or path.  In order to match a
              directory name, make sure  the  pathname  does  not
              include  a  trailing '/' character.  Multiple globs
              may be hidden.

       <B>-hidden-list</B> <I>file</I>
              A file containing a list of <I>globs</I> to get the hidden
              attribute as above.

       <B>-hide-joliet</B> <I>glob</I>
              Hide  <I>glob</I> from being seen on the Joliet directory.
              <I>glob</I> is a shell wild-card-style pattern  that  must
              match  any  part of the filename or path.  Multiple
              globs may be hidden.  If <I>glob</I> matches a  directory,
              then the contents of that directory will be hidden.
              In order to match a directory name, make  sure  the
              pathname does not include a trailing '/' character.
              All the hidden files will still be written  to  the
              output  CD  image  file.   Should  be used with the
              <B>-hide</B> option. See README.hide for more details.

       <B>-hide-joliet-list</B> <I>file</I>
              A file containing a list of <I>globs</I> to be  hidden  as
              above.

       <B>-hide-joliet-trans-tbl</B>
              Hide  the  <B>TRANS.TBL</B>  files  from  the Joliet tree.
              been  specified,  the  resulting  filesystem is not
              ISO9660 level-1 compliant and will not be  readable
              on  MS-DOS.  See also <B>NOTES</B> section for more infor­
              mation on the <B>RR_MOVED</B> directory.

       <B>-l</B>     Allow full 31 character  filenames.   Normally  the
              ISO9660  filename will be in an 8.3 format which is
              compatible with MS-DOS,  even  though  the  ISO9660
              standard  allows  filenames of up to 31 characters.
              If you use this option, the disc may  be  difficult
              to  use on a MS-DOS system, but this comes in handy
              on some other systems (such  as  the  Amiga).   Use
              with caution.

       <B>-input-charset</B> <I>charset</I>
              Input  charset  that defines the characters used in
              local file names.  To get a list of  valid  charset
              names,  call <B>mkisofs</B> <B>-input-charset</B> <B>help.</B>  To get a
              1:1 mapping, you may use <B>default</B> as  charset  name.
              The  default  initial values are <I>cp437</I> on DOS based
              systems and <I>iso8859-1</I> on all  other  systems.   See
              <B>CHARACTER</B> <B>SETS</B> section below for more details.

       <B>-output-charset</B> <I>charset</I>
              Output  charset  that  defines  the characters that
              will be used in Rock Ridge file names. Defaults  to
              the input charset. See <B>CHARACTER</B> <B>SETS</B> section below
              for more details.

       <B>-iso-level</B> <I>level</I>
              Set the iso9660 conformance  level.  Valid  numbers
              are 1..3.

              With level 1, files may only consist of one section
              and filenames are restricted to 8.3 characters.

              With level 2, files may only consist  of  one  sec­
              tion.

              With level 3, no restrictions apply.

              With   all   iso9660   levels   all  filenames  are
              restricted to upper case letters, numbers  and  the
              underscore  (_).  The  maximum  filename  length is
              restricted to 31 characters, the directory  nesting
              level  is  restricted  to  8  and  the maximum path
              length is limited to 255 characters.

       <B>-J</B>     Generate Joliet directory records  in  addition  to
              regular iso9660 file names.  This is primarily use­
              ful when the discs are to be used on Windows-NT  or
              Windows-95  machines.   The  Joliet  filenames  are
              103  is  derived from: the maximum Directory Record
              Length (254), minus the length of Directory  Record
              (33), minus CD-ROM XA System Use Extension Informa­
              tion (14), divided by  the  UTF-16  character  size
              (2).

       <B>-jcharset</B> <I>charset</I>
              Same   as   using  <B>-input-charset</B>  <I>charset</I>  and  <B>-J</B>
              options. See <B>CHARACTER</B> <B>SETS</B> section below for  more
              details.

       <B>-L</B>     Allow  ISO9660  filenames  to  begin with a period.
              Usually, a leading dot is replaced with  an  under­
              score in order to maintain MS-DOS compatibility.
              This  violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens
              to work on many systems.  Use with caution.

       <B>-log-file</B> <I>log</I><B>_</B><I>file</I>
              Redirect all error, warning and informational  mes­
              sages to <I>log</I><B>_</B><I>file</I> instead of the standard error.

       <B>-m</B> <I>glob</I>
              Exclude  <I>glob</I> from being written to CDROM.  <I>glob</I> is
              a shell wild-card-style  pattern  that  must  match
              part  of  the filename (not the path as with option
              <B>-x</B>).   Technically  <I>glob</I>  is  matched  against  the
              <I>d-&gt;d</I><B>_</B><I>name</I>  part  of  the directory entry.  Multiple
              globs may be excluded.  Example:

              mkisofs -o rom -m '*.o' -m core -m foobar

              would exclude all  files  ending  in  ".o",  called
              "core" or "foobar" to be copied to CDROM. Note that
              if you had a directory called "foobar" it too  (and
              of course all its descendants) would be excluded.

              NOTE:  The <B>-m</B> and <B>-x</B> option description should both
              be updated, they are wrong.  Both now work  identi­
              cal  and  use filename globbing. A file is excluded
              if either the last component matches or  the  whole
              path matches.

       <B>-exclude-list</B> <I>file</I>
              A  file containing a list of <I>globs</I> to be exclude as
              above.

       <B>-max-iso9660-filenames</B>
              Allow 37 chars in iso9660 filenames.   This  option
              forces  the  <B>-N</B>  option  as the extra name space is
              taken from the space reserved for ISO-9660  version
              numbers.
              This  violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens
              be a new session which should get  written  to  the
              end  of  the image specified in -M.  Typically this
              requires multi-session capability for the  recorder
              and  cdrom  drive  that you are attempting to write
              this image to.  This option may  only  be  used  in
              conjunction with the <B>-C</B> option.

       <B>-N</B>     Omit version numbers from ISO9660 file names.
              This  violates  the  ISO9660  standard,  but no one
              really uses the version numbers anyway.   Use  with
              caution.

       <B>-new-dir-mode</B> <I>mode</I>
              Mode  to  use  when creating new directories in the
              iso fs image.  The default mode is 0555.

       <B>-nobak</B>

       <B>-no-bak</B>
              Do not include backup files files  on  the  iso9660
              filesystem.   If  the  <B>-no-bak</B> option is specified,
              files that contain the characters '~' or '#' or end
              in '.bak' will not be included (these are typically
              backup files for editors under unix).

       <B>-force-rr</B>
              Do not use  the  automatic  Rock  Ridge  attributes
              recognition  for  previous sessions.  This helps to
              show rotten iso9660 extension records as e.g.  cre­
              ated by NERO burning ROM.

       <B>-no-rr</B> Do  not use the Rock Ridge attributes from previous
              sessions.  This may  help  to  avoid  getting  into
              trouble  when <B>mkisofs</B> finds illegal Rock Ridge sig­
              natures on an old session.

       <B>-no-split-symlink-components</B>
              Don't split the SL components, but begin a new Con­
              tinuation  Area  (CE)  instead. This may waste some
              space, but the SunOS 4.1.4 cdrom driver has  a  bug
              in  reading split SL components (link_size = compo­
              nent_size instead of link_size +=  component_size).

       <B>-no-split-symlink-fields</B>
              Don't split the SL fields, but begin a new Continu­
              ation Area (CE) instead. This may waste some space,
              but  the SunOS 4.1.4 and Solaris 2.5.1 cdrom driver
              have a bug in reading split SL fields (a `/' can be
              dropped).

       <B>-o</B> <I>filename</I>
              is  the  name  of  the  file  to  which the iso9660

              The  padding  is  needed  as many operating systems
              (e.g. Linux) implement read  ahead  bugs  in  their
              filesystem I/O. These bugs result in read errors on
              one or more files that are located at the end of  a
              track.  They  are  usually  present  when the CD is
              written in Track at Once mode or when the  disk  is
              written  as mixed mode CD where an audio track fol­
              lows the data track.

              To avoid problems with I/O error on the  last  file
              on  the  filesystem,  the <B>-pad</B> option has been made
              the default.

       <B>-no-pad</B>
              Do not Pad the end of the  ISO9660  by  16  sectors
              (32kB).

       <B>-path-list</B> <I>file</I>
              A  file  containing  a list of <I>pathspec</I> directories
              and filenames to be added to the  ISO9660  filesys­
              tem. This list of pathspecs are processed after any
              that appear on the command line. If the argument is
              <I>-</I>, then the list is read from the standard input.

       <B>-P</B> <I>publisher</I><B>_</B><I>id</I>
              Specifies  a  text string that will be written into
              the volume header.  This should describe  the  pub­
              lisher of the CDROM, usually with a mailing address
              and phone number.  There is space on the  disc  for
              128  characters of information.  This parameter can
              also be set in the file <B>.mkisofsrc</B> with PUBL=.   If
              specified  in both places, the command line version
              is used.

       <B>-p</B> <I>preparer</I><B>_</B><I>id</I>
              Specifies a text string that will be  written  into
              the  volume  header.  This should describe the pre­
              parer of the CDROM, usually with a mailing  address
              and  phone  number.  There is space on the disc for
              128 characters of information.  This parameter  can
              also  be set in the file <B>.mkisofsrc</B> with PREP=.  If
              specified in both places, the command line  version
              is used.

       <B>-print-size</B>
              Print estimated filesystem size in multiples of the
              sector size (2048 bytes) and exit. This  option  is
              needed  for  Disk  At  Once mode and with some CD-R
              drives when piping directly into <B>cdrecord.</B>  In this
              case  it is needed to know the size of the filesys­
              tem before the actual  CD-creation  is  done.   The

       <B>-quiet</B> This  makes <B>mkisofs</B> even less verbose.  No progress
              output will be provided.

       <B>-R</B>     Generate SUSP and RR records using the  Rock  Ridge
              protocol  to  further  describe  the  files  on the
              iso9660 filesystem.

       <B>-r</B>     This is like the -R option, but file ownership  and
              modes  are  set to more useful values.  The uid and
              gid are set to zero, because they are usually  only
              useful  on  the  author's system, and not useful to
              the client.  All the file read bits are  set  true,
              so that files and directories are globally readable
              on the client.  If any execute bit  is  set  for  a
              file, set all of the execute bits, so that executa­
              bles are globally executable on the client.  If any
              search  bit  is set for a directory, set all of the
              search  bits,  so  that  directories  are  globally
              searchable  on  the  client.   All  write  bits are
              cleared, because the CD-Rom will be  mounted  read-
              only  in any case.  If any of the special mode bits
              are set, clear them, because  file  locks  are  not
              useful  on a read-only file system, and set-id bits
              are not desirable for uid 0 or gid 0.  When used on
              Win32, the execute bit is set on <I>all</I> files. This is
              a result of the lack of file permissions  on  Win32
              and  the  Cygwin  POSIX  emulation layer.  See also
              -uid -gid, -dir-mode, -file-mode and -new-dir-mode.

       <B>-relaxed-filenames</B>
              The  option <B>-relaxed-filenames</B> allows ISO9660 file­
              names to include digits, uppercase  characters  and
              all  other  7  bit ASCII characters (resp. anything
              except lowercase characters).
              This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it  happens
              to work on many systems.  Use with caution.

       <B>-sort</B> <I>sort</I> <I>file</I>
              Sort  file  locations on the media. Sorting is con­
              trolled by a file that contains pairs of  filenames
              and  sorting offset weighting.  If the weighting is
              higher, the file will  be  located  closer  to  the
              beginning  of the media, if the weighting is lower,
              the file will be located closer to the end  of  the
              media. There must be only one space or tabs charac­
              ter between the filename and  the  weight  and  the
              weight  must  be the last characters on a line. The
              filename is taken to include all the characters  up
              to, but not including the last space or tab charac­
              ter on a line. This is to allow for  space  charac­
              ters  to  be in, or at the end of a filename.  This
              option does <B>not</B> sort the order of  the  file  names
              be named: <I>filename</I><B>_</B><I>00</I>,<I>filename</I><B>_</B><I>01,</I>filename_02<I>...</I>

       <B>-sysid</B> <I>ID</I>
              Specifies the system ID.  This parameter  can  also
              be  set in the file <B>.mkisofsrc</B> with SYSI=system_id.
              If specified in both places, the command line  ver­
              sion is used.

       <B>-s</B> <I>silo</I><B>_</B><I>conf</I><B>_</B><I>file</I>
              Specifies the path and filename of the SILO config­
              uration file  to  be  used  when  making  a  "SILO"
              bootable  CD.  The pathname must be relative to the
              source path specified to <B>mkisofs</B> and start  with  a
              slash.  The default is <I>/etc/silo.conf</I> See SILO doc­
              umentation for the syntax of this file.

       <B>-S</B> <I>silo</I><B>_</B><I>bootblock</I>
              Specifies the path and filename of the  SILO  first
              stage  boot  image  to be used when making a "SILO"
              bootable CD. The pathname must be relative  to  the
              source  path  specified to <B>mkisofs.</B>  The default is
              <I>boot/cd.b</I> The boot image must come from SILO  0.8.7
              and higher.

       <B>-T</B>     Generate  a file TRANS.TBL in each directory on the
              CDROM, which can be used on non-Rock Ridge  capable
              systems  to  help establish the correct file names.
              There is also information present in the file  that
              indicates the major and minor numbers for block and
              character devices, and each symlink has the name of
              the link file given.

       <B>-table-name</B> <I>TABLE</I><B>_</B><I>NAME</I>
              Alternative   translation   table  file  name  (see
              above). Implies the <B>-T</B> option.  If you are creating
              a multi-session image you must use the same name as
              in the previous session.

       <B>-ucs-level</B> <I>level</I>
              Set Unicode conformance level in  the  Joliet  SVD.
              The  default  level  is  3.   It may be set to 1..3
              using this option.

       <B>-udf</B>   Include <B>UDF</B> support  in  the  generated  filesystem
              image.   <B>UDF</B>  support  is currently in alpha status
              and for this reason, it is not possible  to  create
              UDF only images.  <B>UDF</B> data structures are currently
              coupled to the Joliet structures, so there are many
              pitfalls  with the current implementation. There is
              no UID/GID support, there is  no  POSIX  permission
              support,  there  is  no support for symlinks.  Note
              that <B>UDF</B> wastes the space from sector ~20 to sector
              on VMS.

       <B>-U</B>     Allows "Untranslated" filenames, completely violat­
              ing the iso9660 standards described  above.  Forces
              on  the -d, -l, -L, -N, -relaxed-filenames, -allow-
              lowercase,  -allow-multidot  and  -no-iso-translate
              flags. It allows more than one '.' character in the
              filename, as well as mixed case filenames.  This is
              useful  on  HP-UX  system,  where the built-in CDFS
              filesystem does not recognize ANY  extensions.  Use
              with extreme caution.

       <B>-no-iso-translate</B>
              Do  not  translate the characters '#' and '~' which
              are invalid for iso9660 filenames.   These  charac­
              ters  are  though  invalid  often used by Microsoft
              systems.
              This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it  happens
              to work on many systems.  Use with caution.

       <B>-V</B> <I>volid</I>
              Specifies  the  volume ID (volume name or label) to
              be written into the master block.   This  parameter
              can  also  be  set  in  the  file  <B>.mkisofsrc</B>  with
              VOLI=id.  If specified in both places, the  command
              line  version  is  used.  Note that if you assign a
              volume ID, this is the name that will  be  used  as
              the  mount point used by the Solaris volume manage­
              ment system and the name that is  assigned  to  the
              disc on a Microsoft Win32 or Apple Mac platform.

       <B>-volset</B> <I>ID</I>
              Specifies  the  volset ID.  This parameter can also
              be set in the file <B>.mkisofsrc</B> with  VOLS=volset_id.
              If  specified in both places, the command line ver­
              sion is used.

       <B>-volset-size</B> <I>#</I>
              Sets the volume set size to #.  The volume set size
              is  the  number  of CD's that are in a CD set.  The
              <B>-volset-size</B> option may be used to create CD's that
              are  part  of  e.g. a Operation System installation
              set of CD's.  The option <B>-volset-size</B> must be spec­
              ified before <B>-volset-seqno</B> on each command line.

       <B>-volset-seqno</B> <I>#</I>
              Sets the volume set sequence number to #.  The vol­
              ume set sequence number is the index number of  the
              current  CD  in  a CD set.  The option <B>-volset-size</B>
              must be specified before <B>-volset-seqno</B> on each com­
              mand line.

              cal and use filename globbing. A file  is  excluded
              if  either  the last component matches or the whole
              path matches.

       <B>-z</B>     Generate special  RRIP  records  for  transparently
              compressed files.  This is only of use and interest
              for hosts that support  transparent  decompression,
              such  as  Linux  2.4.14 or later.  You must specify
              the <B>-R</B> or <B>-r</B> options to enable RockRidge, and  gen­
              erate  compressed  files using the <B>mkzftree</B> utility
              before running <B>mkisofs</B>.  Note that transparent com­
              pression  is  a  nonstandard  Rock Ridge extension.
              The resulting disks are only transparently readable
              if  used  on Linux.  On other operating systems you
              will need to call <B>mkzftree</B> by  hand  to  decompress
              the files.

<H2>HFS OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-hfs</B>   Create an ISO9660/HFS hybrid CD. This option should
              be used in conjunction with the <B>-map</B>, <B>-magic</B> and/or
              the various <I>double</I> <I>dash</I> options given below.

       <B>-apple</B> Create an ISO9660 CD with Apple's extensions. Simi­
              lar to the  <B>-hfs</B>  option,  except  that  the  Apple
              Extensions to ISO9660 are added instead of creating
              an HFS hybrid volume.

       <B>-map</B> <I>mapping</I><B>_</B><I>file</I>
              Use the <I>mapping</I><B>_</B><I>file</I> to set the  CREATOR  and  TYPE
              information  for  a  file  based  on the filename's
              extension. A filename is mapped only if it  is  not
              one  of  the  know Apple/Unix file formats. See the
              <B>HFS</B> <B>CREATOR/TYPE</B> section below.

       <B>-magic</B> <I>magic</I><B>_</B><I>file</I>
              The CREATOR and TYPE information is set by using  a
              file's <I>magic</I> <I>number</I> (usually the first few bytes of
              a file). The <I>magic</I><B>_</B><I>file</I> is only used if a  file  is
              not  one  of  the known Apple/Unix file formats, or
              the filename extension has not  been  mapped  using
              the  <B>-map</B>  option. See the <B>HFS</B> <B>CREATOR/TYPE</B> section
              below for more details.

       <B>-hfs-creator</B> <I>CREATOR</I>
              Set the default CREATOR  for  all  files.  Must  be
              exactly 4 characters. See the <B>HFS</B> <B>CREATOR/TYPE</B> sec­
              tion below for more details.

       <B>-hfs-type</B> <I>TYPE</I>
              Set the default TYPE for all files. Must be exactly
              4  characters.  See  the  <B>HFS</B>  <B>CREATOR/TYPE</B> section
              top  files will be created when the CD is used on a
              Macintosh (and stored in the  System  Folder).   By
              default,  empty  Desktop files are added to the HFS
              volume.

       <B>-mac-name</B>
              Use the HFS filename as the starting point for  the
              ISO9660,  Joliet and Rock Ridge file names. See the
              <B>HFS</B> <B>MACINTOSH</B> <B>FILE</B> <B>NAMES</B>  section  below  for  more
              information.

       <B>-boot-hfs-file</B> <I>driver</I><B>_</B><I>file</I>
              Installs  the  <I>driver</I><B>_</B><I>file</I>  that  <I>may</I>  make  the CD
              bootable on a Macintosh. See the  <B>HFS</B>  <B>BOOT</B>  <B>DRIVER</B>
              section below. (Alpha).

       <B>-part</B>  Generate  an  HFS  partition  table. By default, no
              partition table is generated, but some older Macin­
              tosh  CDROM  drivers need an HFS partition table on
              the CDROM to be able to recognize a hybrid CDROM.

       <B>-auto</B> <I>AutoStart</I><B>_</B><I>file</I>
              Make the HFS CD use  the  QuickTime  2.0  Autostart
              feature  to  launch an application or document. The
              given filename must be the name of  a  document  or
              application located at the top level of the CD. The
              filename must be less than 12 characters.  (Alpha).

       <B>-cluster-size</B> <I>size</I>
              Set  the size in bytes of the cluster or allocation
              units of PC Exchange files. Implies the  <B>--exchange</B>
              option.  See the <B>HFS</B> <B>MACINTOSH</B> <B>FILE</B> <B>FORMATS</B> section
              below.

       <B>-hide-hfs</B> <I>glob</I>
              Hide <I>glob</I> from the HFS volume. The file  or  direc­
              tory  will still exist in the ISO9660 and/or Joliet
              directory.  <I>glob</I> is a shell wild-card-style pattern
              that  must  match any part of the filename Multiple
              globs may be excluded.  Example:

              mkisofs -o rom -hfs -hide-hfs '*.o' -hide-hfs  foo­
              bar

              would  exclude  all  files ending in ".o" or called
              "foobar" from the HFS volume. Note that if you  had
              a  directory  called "foobar" it too (and of course
              all its descendants) would be excluded.   The  <I>glob</I>
              can  also  be  a  path  name relative to the source
              directories given on the command line. Example:

              mkisofs -o rom -hfs -hide-hfs src/html src

       <B>-hfs-volid</B> <I>hfs</I><B>_</B><I>volid</I>
              Volume name for the HFS partition. This is the name
              that  is  assigned  to  the disc on a Macintosh and
              replaces the <I>volid</I> used with the <B>-V</B> option

       <B>-icon-position</B>
              Use the icon position information,  if  it  exists,
              from the Apple/Unix file.  The icons will appear in
              the same position as  they  would  on  a  Macintosh
              desktop.  Folder  location  and size on screen, its
              scroll positions, folder View (view as Icons, Small
              Icons,  etc.)  are also preserved.  This option may
              become set by default in the future.  (Alpha).

       <B>-root-info</B> <I>file</I>
              Set the location, size on screen, scroll positions,
              folder View etc. for the root folder of an HFS vol­
              ume.  See  README.rootinfo  for  more  information.

       <B>-prep-boot</B> <I>FILE</I>
              PReP  boot  image  file.  Up  to 4 are allowed. See
              README.prep_boot (Alpha)

       <B>-input-hfs-charset</B> <I>charset</I>
              Input charset that defines the characters  used  in
              HFS file names when used with the <I>-mac-name</I> option.
              The default charset is cp10000 (Mac Roman)  <I>cp10000</I>
              (Mac  Roman)  See  <B>CHARACTER</B> <B>SETS</B> and <B>HFS</B> <B>MACINTOSH</B>

       <B>-output-hfs-charset</B> <I>charset</I>
              Output charset that  defines  the  characters  that
              will be used in the HFS file names. Defaults to the
              input charset. See <B>CHARACTER</B> <B>SETS</B> section below for
              more details.

       <B>-hfs-unlock</B>
              By  default, <B>mkisofs</B> will create an HFS volume that
              is <I>locked</I>.  This option leaves the volume  unlocked
              so  that  other  applications  (e.g.  hfsutils) can
              modify the volume. See the <B>HFS</B> <B>PROBLEMS/LIMITATIONS</B>
              section below for warnings about using this option.

       <B>-hfs-bless</B> <I>folder</I><B>_</B><I>name</I>
              "Bless" the given directory (folder). This is  usu­
              ally  the <B>System</B> <B>Folder</B> and is used in creating HFS
              bootable CDs. The name of the directory must be the
              whole  path  name  as  <B>mkisofs</B> sees it. e.g. if the
              given pathspec is ./cddata and the required  folder
              is  called  System Folder, then the whole path name
              is "./cddata/System Folder" (remember to use quotes

</PRE>
<H2>CHARACTER SETS</H2><PRE>
       <B>mkisofs</B>  processes  file names in a POSIX compliant way as
       strings of 8-bit characters.  To represent all codings for
       all  languages,  8-bit characters are not sufficient. Uni­
       code or <B>ISO-10646</B> define character codings  that  need  at
       least  21  bits to represent all known languages. They may
       be  represented  with  <B>UTF-32</B>,  <B>UTF-16</B>  or  <B>UTF-8</B>  coding.
       <B>UTF-32</B>  uses  a plain 32-bit coding but seems to be uncom­
       mon.  <B>UTF-16</B> is used by Microsoft with Win32 with the dis­
       advantage  that it only supports a subset of all codes and
       that 16-bit characters are not compliant  with  the  POSIX
       filesystem interface.

       Modern  UNIX  operating  systems  may use <B>UTF-8</B> coding for
       tunately, Apple uses completely  nonstandard  codings  and
       Microsoft  uses  a  Unicode  coding that is not compatible
       with the POSIX filename interface.

       For all non <B>UTF-8</B>  coded  operating  systems,  the  actual
       character that each byte represents depends on the <I>charac­</I>
       <I>ter</I> <I>set</I> or <I>codepage</I> (which is the name used by  Microsoft)
       used by the local operating system in use - the characters
       in a character set will reflect the region or natural lan­
       guage used by the user.

       Usually  character codes 0x00-0x1f are control characters,
       codes 0x20-0x7f are the 7 bit  ASCII  characters  and  (on
       PC's  and  Mac's) 0x80-0xff are used for other characters.
       Unfortunately even this does not follow ISO standards that
       reserve  the  range  0x80-0x9f  for control characters and
       only allow 0xa0-0xff for other characters.

       As there is a lot more than 256 characters/symbols in use,
       only  a  small  subset are represented in a character set.
       Therefore the same character code may represent a  differ­
       ent  character in different character sets. So a file name
       generated, say in central Europe, may not display the same
       character when viewed on a machine in, say eastern Europe.

       To make matters more complicated, different operating sys­
       tems  use  different character sets for the region or lan­
       guage. For example the character code for  "small  e  with
       acute  accent"  may  be  character code 0x82 on a PC, code
       0x8e on a Macintosh and code 0xe9 on a UNIX system.   Note
       while  the  codings  used  on a PC or Mac are nonstandard,
       Unicode codes this  character  as  0x00000000e9  which  is
       basically  the  same  value as the value used by most UNIX
       systems.

       As long as not all operating systems and applications will
       use  the Unicode character set as the basis for file names
       in a unique way, it may  be  necessary  to  specify  which
       character  set  your file names use in and which character
       set the file names should appear on the CD.

       There are four options to specify the character  sets  you
       want to use:

       -input-charset
              Defines  the  local  character set you are using on
              your host machine.  Any character  set  conversions
              that  take place will use this character set as the
              staring point. The default input character sets are
              <I>cp437</I>  on  DOS  based  systems and <I>iso8859-1</I> on all
              other systems.

              same as the input character set.

       -input-hfs-charset
              Defines  the  HFS  character  set used for HFS file
              names decoded from any of  the  various  Apple/Unix
              file  formats. Only useful when used with <I>-mac-name</I>
              option. See the <B>HFS</B> <B>MACINTOSH</B> <B>FILE</B> <B>NAMES</B>  for  more
              information. Defaults to <I>cp10000</I> (Mac Roman).

       -output-hfs-charset
              Defines  the  HFS  character set used to create HFS
              file names from the input character set in use.  In
              most  cases  this  will  be  from the character set
              given with the <I>-input-charset</I> option.  Defaults  to
              the input HFS character set.

       There  are a number of character sets built in to <I>mkisofs</I>.
       To get a listing, use <B>mkisofs</B> <B>-input-charset</B> <B>help.</B>

       Additional character sets can be read from file for any of
       the  character  set  options  by  giving a filename as the
       argument to the options. The given file will only be  read
       if  its  name does not match one of the built in character
       sets.

       The format of the character set files is the same  as  the
       mapping  files  available from http://www.unicode.org/Pub­
       lic/MAPPINGS The format of these files is:

            Column #1 is the input byte code (in hex as 0xXX)
            Column #2 is the Unicode (in hex as 0xXXXX)
            Rest of the line is ignored.

       Any blank line, line without two (or more) columns in  the
       above  format or comments lines (starting with the # char­
       acter) are ignored without any warnings. Any missing input
       code is mapped to Unicode character 0x0000.

       Note  that there is no support for 16 bit UNICODE (UTF-16)
       or 32 bit UNICODE (UTF-32) coding because this  coding  is
       not  POSIX  compliant.  There  should be support for UTF-8
       UNICODE coding which is compatible to POSIX filenames  and
       supported by moder UNIX implementations such as Solaris.

       A  1:1  character  set mapping can be defined by using the
       keyword <I>default</I> as the argument to any  of  the  character
       set  options.  This is the behaviour of older (v1.12) ver­
       sions of <B>mkisofs</B>.

       The ISO9660 file names generated from the input  filenames
       are  not  converted  from  the  input  character  set. The
       ISO9660 character set is a  very  limited  subset  of  the
       on a Macintosh.

       The CREATOR and TYPE information is stored in all the var­
       ious Apple/Unix encoded files.  For other files it is pos­
       sible  to  base  the  CREATOR  and  TYPE on the filename's
       extension using a <I>mapping</I> file (the  <B>-map</B>  option)  and/or
       using  the  <I>magic</I> <I>number</I> (usually a <I>signature</I> in the first
       few bytes) of a file (the <B>-magic</B> option).  If  both  these
       options are given, then their order on the command line is
       important. If the <B>-map</B> option is given first, then a file­
       name  extension  match  is attempted before a magic number
       match. However, if the <B>-magic</B> option is given first,  then
       a magic number match is attempted before a filename exten­
       sion match.

       If a mapping or magic file is not used,  or  no  match  is
       found  then  the  default CREATOR and TYPE for all regular
       files can be set by using entries in the  <B>.mkisofsrc</B>  file
       or using the <B>-hfs-creator</B> and/or <B>-hfs-type</B> options, other­
       wise the default CREATOR and TYPE are 'unix' and 'TEXT'.

       The format of the <I>mapping</I> file is the same <I>afpfile</I>  format
       as  used  by  <I>aufs</I>.   This  file  has five columns for the
       <I>extension</I>, <I>file</I> <I>translation</I>, <I>CREATOR</I>,  <I>TYPE</I>  and  <I>Comment</I>.
       Lines  starting  with  the '#' character are comment lines
       and are ignored. An example file would be like:

       # Example filename mapping file
       #
       # EXTN   XLate   CREATOR   TYPE     Comment
       .tif     Raw     '8BIM'    'TIFF'   "Photoshop TIFF image"
       .hqx     Ascii   'BnHq'    'TEXT'   "BinHex file"
       .doc     Raw     'MSWD'    'WDBN'   "Word file"
       .mov     Raw     'TVOD'    'MooV'   "QuickTime Movie"
       *        Ascii   'ttxt'    'TEXT'   "Text file"

       Where:

              The first column <I>EXTN</I>  defines  the  Unix  filename
              extension to be mapped. The default mapping for any
              filename extension that doesn't  match  is  defined
              with the "*" character.

              The  <I>Xlate</I> column defines the type of text transla­
              tion between the Unix  and  Macintosh  file  it  is
              ignored  by  <B>mkisofs</B>,  but is kept to be compatible
              with <B>aufs(1)</B>.  Although <B>mkisofs</B> does not alter  the
              contents  of a file, if a binary file has it's TYPE
              set as 'TEXT', it <I>may</I> be read incorrectly on a Mac­
              intosh.  Therefore  a better choice for the default
              TYPE may be '????'

       character are comment lines and are  ignored.  An  example
       file would be like:

       # Example magic file
       #
       # off   type      test       message
       0       string    GIF8       8BIM GIFf  GIF image
       0       beshort   0xffd8     8BIM JPEG  image data
       0       string    SIT!       SIT! SIT!  StuffIt Archive
       0       string    \037\235   LZIV ZIVU  standard unix compress
       0       string    \037\213   GNUz ZIVU  gzip compressed data
       0       string    %!         ASPS TEXT  Postscript
       0       string    \004%!     ASPS TEXT  PC Postscript with a ^D to start
       4       string    moov       txtt MooV  QuickTime movie file (moov)
       4       string    mdat       txtt MooV  QuickTime movie file (mdat)

       The  format  of  the file is described in the <B>magic(4)</B> man
       page. The only difference here is that for each  entry  in
       the magic file, the <I>message</I> for the initial offset <B>must</B> be
       4 characters for the CREATOR followed by 4 characters  for
       the TYPE - white space is optional between them. Any other
       characters on this line are ignored.   Continuation  lines
       (starting  with a '&gt;') are also ignored i.e. only the ini­
       tial offset lines are used.

       Using the <B>-magic</B> option may  significantly  increase  pro­
       cessing  time  as each file has to opened and read to find
       it's magic number.

       In summary, for all files, the default CREATOR  is  'unix'
       and  the  default TYPE is 'TEXT'.  These can be changed by
       using entries in the <I>.mkisofsrc</I> file or by using the <B>-hfs-</B>
       <B>creator</B> and/or <B>-hfs-type</B> options.

       If  the  a  file is in one of the known Apple/Unix formats
       (and the format has been selected), then the  CREATOR  and
       TYPE  are  taken  from the values stored in the Apple/Unix
       file.

       Other files can have their CREATOR and TYPE set from their
       file name extension (the <B>-map</B> option), or their magic num­
       ber (the <B>-magic</B> option). If the default match is  used  in
       the  <I>mapping</I>  file, then these values override the default
       CREATOR and TYPE.

       A   full   CREATOR/TYPE   database   can   be   found   at
       http://www.angelfire.com/il/szekely/index.html

<H2>HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS</H2><PRE>
       Macintosh  files  have  two  parts  called  the  <I>Data</I>  and
       <I>Resource</I> fork. Either may be empty. Unix (and  many  other
       <I>info</I>).   Unfortunately, it seems that every software pack­
       age that stores Macintosh files on Unix has chosen a  com­
       pletely different storage method.

       The  Apple/Unix  formats that <I>mkisofs</I> (partially) supports
       are:

       CAP AUFS format
              Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork in subdi­
              rectory  .resource with same filename as data fork.
              Finder info in .finderinfo subdirectory  with  same
              filename.

       AppleDouble/Netatalk
              Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork stored in
              a file with same name  prefixed  with  "%".  Finder
              info  also  stored  in same "%" file. Netatalk uses
              the same format, but the  resource  fork/finderinfo
              stored  in subdirectory .AppleDouble with same name
              as data fork.

       AppleSingle
              Data structures similar to above, except both forks
              and finder info are stored in one file.

       Helios EtherShare
              Data  fork  stored  in  a  file.  Resource fork and
              finder info together  in  subdirectory  .rsrc  with
              same filename as data fork.

       IPT UShare
              Very  similar  to  the  EtherShare  format, but the
              finder info is stored slightly differently.

       MacBinary
              Both forks and finder info stored in one file.

       Apple PC Exchange
              Used by Macintoshes to store  Apple  files  on  DOS
              (FAT)  disks.  Data fork stored in a file. Resource
              fork    in    subdirectory     resource.frk     (or
              RESOURCE.FRK).  Finder  info  as one record in file
              finder.dat (or FINDER.DAT). Separate finder.dat for
              each data fork directory.

              Note:  <I>mkisofs</I> needs to know the native FAT cluster
              size of the disk that the PC Exchange files are  on
              (or  have  been copied from). This size is given by
              the <B>-cluster-size</B> option.  The cluster  or  alloca­
              tion  size  can  be  found by using the DOS utility
              <B>CHKDSK</B>.

              servers.  Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork
              in  subdirectory resource.frk. Uses the AppleDouble
              format to store resource fork.

       Services for Macintosh
              Format of  files  stored  by  NT  Servers  on  NTFS
              filesystems.  Data  fork  is  stored as "filename".
              Resource fork stored as a NTFS <I>stream</I> called "file­
              name:AFP_Resource".  The finder info is stored as a
              NTFS <I>stream</I>  called  "filename:Afp_AfpInfo".  These
              streams are normally invisible to the user.

              Warning:  mkisofs  only  partially supports the SFM
              format. If an HFS file or folder stored on  the  NT
              server  contains  an  <I>illegal</I>  NT  character in its
              name, then NT converts these characters to  <I>Private</I>
              <I>Use</I> <I>Unicode</I> characters. The characters are: " * / &lt;
              &gt; ?  | also a space or period if  it  is  the  last
              character of the file name, character codes 0x01 to
              0x1f (control characters) and Apple' apple logo.

              Unfortunately, these private Unicode characters are
              not  readable  by the mkisofs NT executable. There­
              fore any file or directory  name  containing  these
              characters will be ignored - including the contents
              of any such directory.

       MacOS X AppleDouble
              When HFS/HFS+ files are copied or saved by MacOS  X
              on  to  a non-HFS file system (e.g. UFS, NFS etc.),
              the files are stored in AppleDouble  format.   Data
              fork  stored  in  a file. Resource fork stored in a
              file with same name prefixed with "._". Finder info
              also stored in same "._" file.

       MacOS X HFS (Alpha)
              Not  really  an  Apple/Unix  encoding,  but  actual
              HFS/HFS+ files on  a  MacOS  X  system.  Data  fork
              stored  in a file. Resource fork stored in a pseudo
              file with the same name with  the  suffix  '/rsrc'.
              The  finderinfo  is  only  available  via a MacOS X
              library call.

              Notes: (also see README.macosx)

              Only works when used on MacOS X.

              If a file is found with a zero length resource fork
              and empty finderinfo, it is assumed not to have any
              Apple/Unix encoding - therefore a TYPE and  CREATOR
              can be set using other methods.


       The Apple extensions  require  the  resource  fork  to  be
       stored  as  an  ISO9660 <I>associated</I> file. This is just like
       any normal file stored in the  ISO9660  filesystem  except
       that  the  associated  file  flag  is set in the Directory
       Record (bit 2). This file has the same name  as  the  data
       fork  (the  file  seen  by non-Apple machines). Associated
       files are normally ignored by other OSs

       When using the <B>-hfs</B> option,  the  TYPE  and  CREATOR  plus
       other finder info, are stored in a separate HFS directory,
       not visible on the ISO9660 volume. The HFS directory  ref­
       erences  the  same  data and resource fork files described
       above.

       In most cases, it is better to use the <B>-hfs</B> option instead
       of  the  <B>-apple</B>  option, as the latter imposes the limited
       ISO9660 characters  allowed  in  filenames.  However,  the
       Apple  extensions do give the advantage that the files are
       packed on the disk more efficiently and it may be possible
       to  fit more files on a CD - important when the total size
       of the source files is approaching 650MB.



</PRE>
<H2>HFS MACINTOSH FILE NAMES</H2><PRE>
       Where possible, the HFS filename that is  stored  with  an
       Apple/Unix  file  is used for the HFS part of the CD. How­
       ever, not all the Apple/Unix encodings store the HFS file­
       name  with  the finderinfo. In these cases, the Unix file­
       name is used - with escaped  special  characters.  Special
       characters include '/' and characters with codes over 127.

       Aufs escapes these characters by using ":" followed by the
       character  code as two hex digits. Netatalk and EtherShare
       have a similar scheme, but uses "%" instead of a ":".

       If mkisofs can't find an HFS filename, then  it  uses  the
       Unix  name,  with any %xx or :xx characters (xx == two hex
       digits) converted to a single character code. If "xx"  are
       not  hex  digits ([0-9a-fA-F]), then they are left alone -
       although any remaining ":" is converted to "%" as colon is
       the  HFS  directory  separator.  Care must be taken, as an
       ordinary Unix file with %xx or :xx will also be converted.
       e.g.

       This:2fFile   converted to This/File

       This:File     converted to This%File

       This:t7File   converted to This%t7File

       Although  HFS  filenames appear to support upper and lower
       file called <I>someimage.gif</I>, then  this  is  the  name  that
       would  appear  on  the  HFS  part  of  the CD. However, as
       mkisofs uses the Unix name as the starting point  for  the
       other names, then the ISO9660 name generated will probably
       be <I>SOMEIMAG.BIN</I> and the Joliet/Rock Ridge would be <I>someim­</I>
       <I>age.gif.bin</I>.  Although the actual data (in this case) is a
       GIF image. This option will use the HFS  filename  as  the
       starting  point  and  the  ISO9660  name  will probably be
       <I>SOMEIMAG.GIF</I> and the Joliet/Rock Ridge  would  be  <I>someim­</I>
       <I>age.gif</I>.

       Using  the  <B>-mac-name</B>  option will not currently work with
       the <B>-T</B> option  -  the  Unix  name  will  be  used  in  the
       TRANS.TBL file, not the Macintosh name.

       The  character  set used to convert any HFS file name to a
       Joliet/Rock Ridge  file  name  defaults  to  <I>cp10000</I>  (Mac
       Roman).  The character set used can be specified using the
       <I>-input-hfs-charset</I> option. Other built  in  HFS  character
       sets   are:  cp10006  (MacGreek),  cp10007  (MacCyrillic),
       cp10029 (MacLatin2), cp10079 (MacIcelandandic) and cp10081
       (MacTurkish).

       Note:  the  character  codes  used by HFS file names taken
       from the various Apple/Unix formats will not be  converted
       as  they  are assumed to be in the correct Apple character
       set. Only the Joliet/Rock Ridge names derived from the HFS
       file names will be converted.

       The  existing  mkisofs  code  will  filter out any illegal
       characters for the ISO9660 and Joliet  filenames,  but  as
       mkisofs expects to be dealing directly with Unix names, it
       leaves the Rock Ridge names as is.  But as '/' is a  legal
       HFS  filename character, the <B>-mac-name</B> option converts '/'
       to a '_' in Rock Ridge filenames.

       If the Apple extensions are used, then  only  the  ISO9660
       filenames  will  appear  on the Macintosh. However, as the
       Macintosh ISO9660 drivers can use <I>Level</I> <I>2</I> filenames,  then
       you  can use options like <B>-allow-multidot</B> without problems
       on a Macintosh - still take care over the names, for exam­
       ple  <I>this.file.name</I>  will  be  converted to <I>THIS.FILE</I> i.e.
       only have one '.', also filename <I>abcdefgh</I> will be seen  as
       <I>ABCDEFGH</I>  but  <I>abcdefghi</I>  will be seen as <I>ABCDEFGHI.</I>  i.e.
       with a '.' at the end - don't know if this is a  Macintosh
       problem or mkisofs/mkhybrid problem. All filenames will be
       in uppercase  when  viewed  on  a  Macintosh.  Of  course,
       DOS/Win3.X  machines will not be able to see Level 2 file­
       names...

       with the HFS module  installed,  mount  the  floppy  using
       something like:

                  mount -t hfs /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy

       The  floppy  will  be  mounted  as  a  CAP  file system by
       default. Then run mkisofs using something like:

                  mkisofs --cap -o output source_dir /mnt/floppy

       If you are not using Linux, then you can use the  hfsutils
       to  copy  the icon file from the floppy. However, care has
       to be taken, as the icon file contains a  control  charac­
       ter. e.g.

                  hmount /dev/fd0
                  hdir -a
                  hcopy -m Icon^V^M icon_dir/icon

       Where  '^V^M' is control-V followed by control-M. Then run
       <B>mkisofs</B> by using something like:

                  mkisofs --macbin -o output source_dir icon_dir

       The procedure for creating/using custom  folder  icons  is
       very  similar  -  paste an icon to folder's "Get Info" box
       and transfer the resulting 'Icon\r' file to  the  relevant
       directory in the mkisofs source tree.

       You  may  want to hide the icon files from the ISO9660 and
       Joliet trees.

       To give a custom icon to a Joliet CD, follow the  instruc­
       tions       found      at:      http://www.fadden.com/cdr­

<H2>HFS BOOT DRIVER</H2><PRE>
       It <I>may</I> be possible to make the hybrid  CD  bootable  on  a
       Macintosh.

       A bootable HFS CD requires an Apple CD-ROM (or compatible)
       driver, a bootable HFS partition and the necessary System,
       Finder, etc. files.

       A driver can be obtained from any other Macintosh bootable
       CD-ROM using the <I>apple</I><B>_</B><I>driver</I> utility. This file can  then
       be used with the <B>-boot-hfs-file</B> option.

       The  HFS partition (i.e. the hybrid disk in our case) must
       contain a suitable System Folder, again from  another  CD-
       ROM or disk.

       PLEASE NOTE
              By  using  a  driver  from  an Apple CD and copying
              Apple software to your CD,  you  become  liable  to
              obey  Apple  Computer, Inc. Software License Agree­
              ments.

<H2>EL TORITO BOOT INFORMATION TABLE</H2><PRE>
       When the <B>-boot-info-table</B> option is  given,  <B>mkisofs</B>  will
       modify the boot file specified by the <B>-b</B> option by insert­
       ing a 56-byte "boot information table" at offset 8 in  the
       file.  This modification is done in the source filesystem,
       so make sure you use a copy if this  file  is  not  easily
       recreated!   This  file contains pointers which may not be
       easily or reliably obtained at boot time.

       The format of this table is as follows; all  integers  are
       in section 7.3.1 ("little endian") format.

         Offset    Name           Size      Meaning
          8        bi_pvd         4 bytes   LBA of primary volume descriptor
         12        bi_file        4 bytes   LBA of boot file
         16        bi_length      4 bytes   Boot file length in bytes
         20        bi_csum        4 bytes   32-bit checksum
         24        bi_reserved    40 bytes  Reserved

       The  32-bit checksum is the sum of all the 32-bit words in
       the boot file starting at  byte  offset  64.   All  linear
       block  addresses  (LBAs) are given in CD sectors (normally
       2048 bytes).

<H2>CONFIGURATION</H2><PRE>
       <B>mkisofs</B> looks for the <B>.mkisofsrc</B> file, first in  the  cur­
       rent working directory, then in the user's home directory,
       and then in the directory in which the <B>mkisofs</B>  binary  is
       stored.  This file is assumed to contain a series of lines
       of the form <B>TAG=</B><I>value,</I> and in this  way  you  can  specify
       certain  options.  The case of the tag is not significant.
       Some fields in the volume header are not settable  on  the
       command  line,  but  can be altered through this facility.
       Comments may be placed in this  file,  using  lines  which
       start with a hash (#) character.

       <B>APPI</B>   The  application  identifier  should  describe  the
              application that will be on  the  disc.   There  is
              space  on  the  disc for 128 characters of informa­
              tion.  May be overridden using the <B>-A</B> command  line
              option.

       <B>COPY</B>   The copyright information, often the name of a file
              on the disc containing the copyright notice.  There
              is  space in the disc for 37 characters of informa­

       <B>PREP</B>   This  should  describe  the  preparer of the CDROM,
              usually with a mailing address  and  phone  number.

              den using the <B>-volset</B> command line option.

       <B>HFS_TYPE</B>
              The  default  TYPE  for  Macintosh  files.  Must be
              exactly 4 characters.  May be overridden using  the
              <B>-hfs-type</B> command line option.

       <B>HFS_CREATOR</B>
              The  default  CREATOR  for Macintosh files. Must be

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
       To  create a vanilla ISO-9660 filesystem image in the file
       <I>cd.iso</I>, where the directory <I>cd</I><B>_</B><I>dir</I> will  become  the  root
       directory if the CD, call:

       % mkisofs -o cd.iso cd_dir

       To  create  a  CD with Rock Ridge extensions of the source
       directory <I>cd</I><B>_</B><I>dir</I>:

       % mkisofs -o cd.iso -R cd_dir

       % mkisofs -o cd.iso --netatalk cd_dir

       To create a  HFS  hybrid  CD  from  the  source  directory
       <I>cd</I><B>_</B><I>dir</I>,  giving  all files CREATOR and TYPES based on just
       their filename extensions listed in the file "mapping".:

       % mkisofs -o cd.iso -map mapping cd_dir

       To create a CD with the  'Apple  Extensions  to  ISO9660',
       from the source directories <I>cd</I><B>_</B><I>dir</I> and <I>another</I><B>_</B><I>dir.</I>  Files
       in all the known Apple/Unix format  are  decoded  and  any
       other  files  are  given  CREATOR  and TYPE based on their
       magic number given in the file "magic":

       % mkisofs -o cd.iso -apple -magic magic -probe \
               cd_dir another_dir

       The following example puts different files on the CD  that
       all have the name README, but have different contents when
       seen as a ISO9660/RockRidge, Joliet or HFS CD.

       Current directory contains:

       % ls -F
       README.hfs     README.joliet  README.unix    cd_dir/

       The following command puts the contents of  the  directory
       <I>cd</I><B>_</B><I>dir</I>  on  the CD along with the three README files - but
       only one will be seen from each of the three filesystems:

       % mkisofs -o cd.iso -hfs -J -r -graft-points \
               -hide README.hfs -hide README.joliet \
               -hide-joliet README.hfs -hide-joliet README.unix \
               -hide-hfs README.joliet -hide-hfs README.unix \
               README=README.hfs README=README.joliet \
               README=README.unix cd_dir

       i.e. the file README.hfs will be seen as README on the HFS
       CD and the other two README files will  be  hidden.  Simi­
       larly for the Joliet and ISO9660/RockRidge CD.

       There  are  probably all sorts of strange results possible
       with combinations of the hide options ...

       <B>mkisofs</B> is not based on the standard mk*fs tools for unix,
       because  we  must generate a complete  copy of an existing
       filesystem on a disk in the  iso9660 filesystem.  The name
       mkisofs is probably a bit of a misnomer, since it not only
       creates the filesystem, but it also populates it as  well.
       However,  the  appropriate  tool name for a UNIX tool that

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       <B>Mkisofs</B>  may  safely  be  installed suid root. This may be
       needed to allow <B>mkisofs</B> to read the previous session  when
       creating a multi session image.

       If  <B>mkisofs</B> is creating a filesystem image with Rock Ridge
       attributes and the directory nesting level of  the  source
       directory  tree  is too much for ISO-9660, <B>mkisofs</B> will do
       deep directory relocation.  This results  in  a  directory
       called  <B>RR_MOVED</B> in the root directory of the CD. You can­
       not avoid this directory.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       ·      Any files that have hard links to files not in  the
              tree  being  copied  to the iso9660 filesystem will
              have an incorrect file reference count.

       ·      Does not check for SUSP record(s) in "."  entry  of
              the  root directory to verify the existence of Rock
              Ridge enhancements.

              This problem is present when reading  old  sessions
              while adding data in multi-session mode.

       ·      Does  not  properly  read  relocated directories in
              multi-session mode when adding data.

              Any relocated deep directory is  lost  if  the  new
              session does not include the deep directory.

              Repeat by: create first session with deep directory
              relocation then add new session with a  single  dir
              that differs from the old deep path.

       ·      Does  not  re-use RR_MOVED when doing multi-session
              from TRANS.TBL

       ·      Does not create whole_name entry  for  RR_MOVED  in
              multi-session mode.

</PRE>
<H2>HFS PROBLEMS/LIMITATIONS</H2><PRE>
       I have had to make several assumptions on how I expect the
       modified  libhfs  routines  to  work, however there may be
       HFS file/directory names that share the first  31  charac­
       ters  have  _N'  (N == decimal number) substituted for the
       last few characters to generate unique names.

       Care must be taken when  "grafting"  Apple/Unix  files  or
       directories   (see   above   for  the  method  and  syntax
       involved). It is not possible to use a  new  name  for  an
       Apple/Unix  encoded  file/directory.  e.g. If a Apple/Unix
       encoded file called "oldname" is to added to the CD,  then
       you can not use the command line:

              mkisofs   -o  output.raw  -hfs  -graft-points  new­
              name=oldname cd_dir

       mkisofs will be unable to decode "oldname".  However,  you
       can  graft Apple/Unix encoded files or directories as long
       as you do not attempt to give them new names as above.

       When creating an HFS volume with the multisession options,
       <B>-M</B>  and  <B>-C</B>, only files in the last session will be in the
       HFS volume. i.e. mkisofs can not <I>add</I> existing  files  from
       previous sessions to the HFS volume.

       However, if each session is created with the <B>-part</B> option,
       then each session will appear  as  separate  volumes  when
       mounted  on  a Mac. In this case, it is worth using the <B>-V</B>
       or <B>-hfs-volid</B> option to give each session a unique  volume
       name,  otherwise  each "volume" will appear on the Desktop
       with the same name.

       Symbolic links (as with all other non-regular  files)  are
       not added to the HFS directory.

       Hybrid  volumes  may  be  larger than pure ISO9660 volumes
       containing the same data. In some cases  (e.g.  DVD  sized
       volumes) the hybrid volume may be significantly larger. As
       an HFS volume gets bigger, so does  the  allocation  block
       size  (the  smallest  amount  of space a file can occupy).
       For a 650Mb CD, the allocation block is 10Kb, for a  4.7Gb
       DVD it will be about 70Kb.

       The  maximum  number  of  files  in an HFS volume is about
       65500 - although the real limit will be somewhat less than
       this.

       The  resulting  hybrid  volume  can  be accessed on a Unix
       machine  by  using  the  hfsutils  routines.  However,  no
       changes  can be made to the volume as it is set as <B>locked.</B>
       The option <B>-hfs-unlock</B> will create an output image that is
       unlocked  -  however no changes should be made to the con­
       tents of the volume (unless you really know what  you  are
       doing) as it's not a "real" HFS volume.
       files should be mounted as  type  <B>msdos</B>  (not  <B>vfat</B>)  when
       using Linux.

       The  SFM format is only partially supported - see <B>HFS</B> <B>MAC­</B>
       <B>INTOSH</B> <B>FILE</B> <B>FORMATS</B> section above.

       It is not possible to use the the <B>-sparc-boot</B> or <B>-generic-</B>
       <B>boot</B>   options   with  the  <B>-boot-hfs-file</B>  or  <B>-prep-boot</B>
       options.

       <B>mkisofs</B> should be able to create HFS  hybrid  images  over
       4Gb, although this has not been fully tested.
