<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>Gzip</I>  reduces the size of the named files using Lempel-Ziv
       coding (LZ77).  Whenever possible, each file  is  replaced
       by one with the extension <B>.gz,</B> while keeping the same own­
       ership modes, access and modification times.  (The default
       extension  is  <B>-gz</B> for VMS, <B>z</B> for MSDOS, OS/2 FAT, Windows
       NT FAT and Atari.)  If no files are  specified,  or  if  a
       file  name is "-", the standard input is compressed to the
       standard output.  <I>Gzip</I> will only attempt to compress regu­
       lar  files.  In particular, it will ignore symbolic links.

       If the compressed file name is too long for its file  sys­
       tem,  <I>gzip</I>  truncates  it.  <I>Gzip</I> attempts to truncate only
       the parts of the file name longer than 3  characters.   (A
       part  is delimited by dots.) If the name consists of small
       parts only, the longest parts are truncated. For  example,
       if file names are limited to 14 characters, gzip.msdos.exe
       is compressed to gzi.msd.exe.gz.  Names are not  truncated
       on  systems which do not have a limit on file name length.

       By default, <I>gzip</I> keeps the original file name  and  times­
       tamp  in  the  compressed file. These are used when decom­
       pressing the file with the <B>-N</B> option. This is useful  when
       the  compressed  file  name was truncated or when the time
       stamp was not preserved after a file transfer.

       Compressed files can be restored to  their  original  form
       using  <I>gzip</I>  <I>-d</I>  or  <I>gunzip</I> or <I>zcat.</I>  If the original name
       saved in the compressed file is not suitable for its  file
       system, a new name is constructed from the original one to
       make it legal.

       <I>gunzip</I> takes a list of  files  on  its  command  line  and
       replaces  each file whose name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z,
       _z or .Z and which begins with the  correct  magic  number
       with  an uncompressed file without the original extension.
       <I>gunzip</I> also recognizes the  special  extensions  <B>.tgz</B>  and
       <B>.taz</B>  as  shorthands  for <B>.tar.gz</B> and <B>.tar.Z</B> respectively.
       When compressing, <I>gzip</I> uses the <B>.tgz</B> extension  if  neces­
       sary instead of truncating a file with a <B>.tar</B> extension.

       <I>gunzip</I>  can  currently  decompress  files created by <I>gzip,</I>
       <I>zip,</I> <I>compress,</I> <I>compress</I> <I>-H</I> or <I>pack.</I>  The detection of  the
       input  format is automatic.  When using the first two for­
       mats, <I>gunzip</I> checks a 32 bit CRC. For <I>pack,</I> <I>gunzip</I>  checks
       the  uncompressed length. The standard <I>compress</I> format was
       not designed to allow consistency checks.  However  <I>gunzip</I>

       <I>zcat</I> is identical to <I>gunzip</I> <B>-c.</B>  (On  some  systems,  <I>zcat</I>
       may be installed as <I>gzcat</I> to preserve the original link to
       <I>compress.)</I>  <I>zcat</I> uncompresses either a list  of  files  on
       the  command  line  or  its  standard input and writes the
       uncompressed data on standard output.   <I>zcat</I>  will  uncom­
       press  files  that  have  the correct magic number whether
       they have a <B>.gz</B> suffix or not.

       <I>Gzip</I> uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in <I>zip</I> and  PKZIP.
       The  amount of compression obtained depends on the size of
       the input and the distribution of common substrings.  Typ­
       ically,  text such as source code or English is reduced by
       60-70%.  Compression is generally much  better  than  that
       achieved  by LZW (as used in <I>compress</I>), Huffman coding (as
       used in <I>pack</I>), or adaptive Huffman coding (<I>compact</I>).

       Compression is always performed, even  if  the  compressed
       file  is slightly larger than the original. The worst case
       expansion is a few bytes for the gzip file header, plus  5
       bytes every 32K block, or an expansion ratio of 0.015% for
       large files. Note that the  actual  number  of  used  disk
       blocks  almost  never increases.  <I>gzip</I> preserves the mode,
       ownership and timestamps  of  files  when  compressing  or
       decompressing.



</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-a</B> <B>--ascii</B>
              Ascii  text  mode: convert end-of-lines using local
              conventions. This option is supported only on  some
              non-Unix  systems. For MSDOS, CR LF is converted to
              LF when compressing, and LF is converted to  CR  LF
              when decompressing.

       <B>-c</B> <B>--stdout</B> <B>--to-stdout</B>
              Write  output  on  standard  output;  keep original
              files unchanged.  If there are several input files,
              the  output consists of a sequence of independently
              compressed members. To obtain  better  compression,
              concatenate  all  input  files  before  compressing
              them.

       <B>-d</B> <B>--decompress</B> <B>--uncompress</B>
              Decompress.

       <B>-f</B> <B>--force</B>
              Force compression or decompression even if the file
              has   multiple  links  or  the  corresponding  file
              already exists, or if the compressed data  is  read
              from or written to a terminal. If the input data is
              not in a format recognized  by  <I>gzip,</I>  and  if  the
                  uncompressed size:  size  of  the  uncompressed
              file
                  ratio: compression ratio (0.0% if unknown)
                  uncompressed_name:  name  of  the  uncompressed
              file

              The uncompressed size is given as -1 for files  not
              in gzip format, such as compressed .Z files. To get
              the uncompressed size for such a file, you can use:

                  zcat file.Z | wc -c

              In  combination with the --verbose option, the fol­
              lowing fields are also displayed:

                  method: compression method
                  crc: the 32-bit CRC of the uncompressed data
                  date &amp; time: time stamp  for  the  uncompressed
              file

              The  compression  methods  currently  supported are
              deflate, compress, lzh (SCO compress -H) and  pack.
              The crc is given as ffffffff for a file not in gzip
              format.

              With --name, the uncompressed name,  date and  time
              are  those  stored within the compress file if pre­
              sent.

              With --verbose, the  size  totals  and  compression
              ratio  for all files is also displayed, unless some
              sizes are unknown.  With  --quiet,  the  title  and
              totals lines are not displayed.

       <B>-L</B> <B>--license</B>
              Display the <I>gzip</I> license and quit.

       <B>-n</B> <B>--no-name</B>
              When  compressing,  do  not  save the original file
              name and time stamp by default. (The original  name
              is  always  saved if the name had to be truncated.)
              When decompressing, do  not  restore  the  original
              file  name  if present (remove only the <I>gzip</I> suffix
              from the compressed file name) and do  not  restore
              the  original  time  stamp if present (copy it from
              the compressed file). This option  is  the  default
              when decompressing.

       <B>-N</B> <B>--name</B>
              When  compressing,  always  save  the original file
              name and time stamp;  this  is  the  default.  When
              decompressing,  restore  the original file name and

       <B>-S</B> <B>.suf</B> <B>--suffix</B> <B>.suf</B>
              Use  suffix  .suf instead of .gz. Any suffix can be
              given, but suffixes other than .z and .gz should be
              avoided  to  avoid  confusion when files are trans­
              ferred to other systems.  A null suffix forces gun­
              zip  to   try  decompression  on  all  given  files
              regardless of suffix, as in:

                  gunzip -S "" *       (*.* for MSDOS)

              Previous versions of gzip used the .z suffix.  This
              was changed to avoid a conflict with <B>pack(1)</B><I>.</I>

       <B>-t</B> <B>--test</B>
              Test. Check the compressed file integrity.

       <B>-v</B> <B>--verbose</B>
              Verbose.  Display the name and percentage reduction
              for each file compressed or decompressed.

       <B>-V</B> <B>--version</B>
              Version. Display the version number and compilation
              options then quit.

       <B>-#</B> <B>--fast</B> <B>--best</B>
              Regulate  the speed of compression using the speci­
              fied digit <I>#</I>, where  <B>-1</B>  or  <B>--fast</B>  indicates  the
              fastest  compression  method (less compression) and
              <B>-9</B> or  <B>--best</B>  indicates  the  slowest  compression
              method (best compression).  The default compression
              level is <B>-6</B> (that is, biased towards high  compres­
              sion at expense of speed).


</PRE>
<H2>ADVANCED USAGE</H2><PRE>
       Multiple  compressed  files  can  be concatenated. In this
       case, <I>gunzip</I> will extract all members at once.  For  exam­
       ple:

             gzip -c file1  &gt; foo.gz
             gzip -c file2 &gt;&gt; foo.gz

       Then
             gunzip -c foo

       is equivalent to

             cat file1 file2

       In  case of damage to one member of a .gz file, other mem­
       bers can still be recovered  (if  the  damaged  member  is
       removed).  However, you can get better compression by com­
       uncompressed size and CRC reported by  the  --list  option
       applies  to  the  last member only. If you need the uncom­
       pressed size for all members, you can use:

             gzip -cd file.gz | wc -c

       If you wish to create a single archive file with  multiple
       members  so  that  members can later be extracted indepen­
       dently, use an archiver such as tar or zip. GNU  tar  sup­
       ports  the -z option to invoke gzip transparently. gzip is
       designed as a complement to tar, not as a replacement.


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
       The environment variable <B>GZIP</B> can hold a  set  of  default
       options for <I>gzip.</I>  These options are interpreted first and
       can be overwritten by explicit  command  line  parameters.
       For example:
             for sh:    GZIP="-8v --name"; export GZIP
             for csh:   setenv GZIP "-8v --name"
             for MSDOS: set GZIP=-8v --name

       On  Vax/VMS,  the  name  of  the  environment  variable is
       GZIP_OPT, to avoid a conflict  with  the  symbol  set  for
       invocation of the program.

</PRE>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
       Exit status is normally 0; if an error occurs, exit status
       is 1. If a warning occurs, exit status is 2.

       Usage: gzip [-cdfhlLnNrtvV19] [-S suffix] [file ...]
               Invalid  options  were  specified  on  the command
               line.
       <I>file</I>: not in gzip format
               The file specified to <I>gunzip</I>  has  not  been  com­
               pressed.
       <I>file:</I> Corrupt input. Use zcat to recover some data.
               The  compressed file has been damaged. The data up
               to the point of failure can be recovered using
                       zcat file &gt; recover
       <I>file</I>: compressed with <I>xx</I> bits, can only handle <I>yy</I> bits
               <I>File</I> was compressed (using LZW) by a program  that
               could deal with more <I>bits</I> than the decompress code
               on this machine.  Recompress the file  with  gzip,
               which compresses better and uses less memory.
       <I>file</I>: already has .gz suffix -- no change
               The  file  is  assumed  to  be already compressed.
               Rename the file and try again.
       <I>file</I> already exists; do you wish to overwrite (y or n)?
               See <B>ln(1)</B> for more information. Use the <B>-f</B> flag to
               force compression of multiply-linked files.


</PRE>
<H2>CAVEATS</H2><PRE>
       When  writing  compressed  data to a tape, it is generally
       necessary to pad the output with  zeroes  up  to  a  block
       boundary.  When  the  data  is read and the whole block is
       passed to <I>gunzip</I> for decompression,  <I>gunzip</I>  detects  that
       there  is extra trailing garbage after the compressed data
       and emits a warning  by  default.  You  have  to  use  the
       --quiet option to suppress the warning. This option can be
       set in the <B>GZIP</B> environment variable as in:
         for sh:  GZIP="-q"  tar -xfz --block-compress /dev/rst0
         for  csh:  (setenv  GZIP  -q;  tar  -xfz   --block-compr
       /dev/rst0

       In the above example, gzip is invoked implicitly by the -z
       option of GNU tar. Make sure that the same block size  (-b
       option  of tar) is used for reading and writing compressed
       data on tapes.  (This example assumes you  are  using  the
       GNU version of tar.)


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       The --list option reports incorrect sizes if they exceed 2
       gigabytes.  The --list option reports sizes as -1 and  crc
       as  ffffffff  if  the compressed file is on a non seekable
       media.

       In some rare cases, the --best option gives worse compres­
       sion  than  the  default  compression  level (-6). On some
       highly redundant files, <I>compress</I>  compresses  better  than
       <I>gzip.</I>
