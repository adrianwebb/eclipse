              force ibs=BYTES and obs=BYTES

       cbs=BYTES
              convert BYTES bytes at a time

       conv=KEYWORDS
              convert the file as per the comma separated keyword
              list

              copy only BLOCKS input blocks

       ibs=BYTES
              read BYTES bytes at a time

       if=FILE
              read from FILE instead of stdin

       obs=BYTES
              write BYTES bytes at a time

       <B>--help</B> display this help and exit

       <B>--version</B>

       BLOCKS  and  BYTES may be followed by the following multi­
       plicative suffixes: xM M, c 1, w 2,  b  512,  kB  1000,  K
       1024,  MB  1,000,000,  M  1,048,576,  GB  1,000,000,000, G
       1,073,741,824, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.  Each  KEYWORD

       ebcdic from ASCII to EBCDIC

       ucase  change lower case to upper case

       swab   swap every pair of input bytes

       noerror
              continue after read errors

       sync   pad  every  input block with NULs to ibs-size; when
              used

              NULs
