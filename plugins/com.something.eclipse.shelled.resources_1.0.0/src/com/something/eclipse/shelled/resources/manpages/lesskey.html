<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>Lesskey</I>  is  used  to  specify a set of key bindings to be
       used by <I>less.</I>   The  input  file  is  a  text  file  which
       describes  the  key  bindings,  If  the input file is "-",
       standard input is read.  If no input file is specified,  a
       standard  filename  is used as the name of the input file,
       which depends on the system being used: On  Unix  systems,
       $HOME/.lesskey  is used; on MS-DOS systems, $HOME/_lesskey
       is used; and on OS/2 systems $HOME/lesskey.ini is used, or
       $INIT/lesskey.ini  if $HOME is undefined.  The output file
       is a binary file which is used by <I>less.</I>  If no output file
       is specified, and the environment variable LESSKEY is set,
       the value of LESSKEY is used as the  name  of  the  output
       file.   Otherwise, a standard filename is used as the name
       of the output file, which  depends  on  the  system  being
       used:  On  Unix  and OS-9 systems, $HOME/.less is used; on
       MS-DOS systems, $HOME/_less is used; and on OS/2  systems,
       $HOME/less.ini  is  used,  or  $INIT/less.ini  if $HOME is
       undefined.  If the output  file  already  exists,  <I>lesskey</I>
       will overwrite it.

       The  -V  or  --version  option causes <I>lesskey</I> to print its
       version number and immediately exit.  If -V  or  --version
       is present, other options and arguments are ignored.

       The  input  file  consists  of one or more <I>sections.</I>  Each
       section starts with a line that  identifies  the  type  of
       section.  Possible sections are:

       #command
              Defines new command keys.

       #line-edit
              Defines new line-editing keys.

       #env   Defines environment variables.

       Blank  lines  and  lines which start with a pound sign (#)
       are ignored, except for the special section header  lines.



</PRE>
<H2>COMMAND SECTION</H2><PRE>
       The command section begins with the line

       #command

       its  octal value.  A backslash followed by certain charac­
       ters specifies input characters as follows:

       \b     BACKSPACE

       \e     ESCAPE

       \n     NEWLINE

       \r     RETURN

       \t     TAB

       \ku    UP ARROW

       \kd    DOWN ARROW

       \kr    RIGHT ARROW

       \kl    LEFT ARROW

       \kU    PAGE UP

       \kD    PAGE DOWN

       \kh    HOME

       \ke    END

       \kx    DELETE

       A backslash followed by any other character indicates that
       character is to be taken literally.  Characters which must
       be preceded by backslash include caret, space, tab and the
       backslash itself.

       An action may be followed by an "extra" string.  When such
       a command is entered while running  <I>less,</I>  the  action  is
       performed, and then the extra string is parsed, just as if
       it were typed in to <I>less.</I>  This feature  can  be  used  in
       certain  cases  to  extend the functionality of a command.
       For example, see the "{" and ":t" commands in the  example
       below.   The  extra  string  has a special meaning for the
       "quit" action: when <I>less</I> quits,  first  character  of  the
       extra string is used as its exit status.

</PRE>
<H2>PRECEDENCE</H2><PRE>
       Commands specified by <I>lesskey</I>  take  precedence  over  the
       default  commands.   A default command key may be disabled
       by  including  it  in  the  input  file  with  the  action
       "invalid".   Alternatively,  a  key  may  be defined to do
       nothing by using the  action  "noaction".   "noaction"  is
       similar to "invalid", but <I>less</I> will give an error beep for
       an "invalid" command, but not for  a  "noaction"  command.
       In  addition,  ALL  default  commands  may  be disabled by
       adding this control line to the input file:

       #stop

       This will cause all default commands to be  ignored.   The
       #stop  line should be the last line in that section of the
       file.

       Be aware that #stop can be dangerous.  Since  all  default
       commands  are  disabled,  you must provide sufficient com­
       mands before  the  #stop  line  to  enable  all  necessary
       actions.  For example, failure to provide a "quit" command

       line-editing keys used by less:

            \17       back-complete
            \e\t      back-complete
            ^L        expand
            ^V        literal
            ^A        literal

<H2>LESS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2><PRE>
       The environment variable section begins with the line

       #env

       Following  this  line  is  a  list of environment variable
       assignments.  Each line consists of an  environment  vari­
       able name, an equals sign (=) and the value to be assigned
       to the environment variable.  White space before and after
       the  equals  sign  is ignored.  Variables assigned in this
       way are visible only to <I>less.</I>  If a variable is  specified
       in  the system environment and also in a lesskey file, the
       value in the lesskey file takes precedence.  Although  the
       lesskey  file can be used to override variables set in the
       environment, the main purpose of  assigning  variables  in
       the  lesskey file is simply to have all <I>less</I> configuration
       <B>less(1)</B>



</PRE>
<H2>WARNINGS</H2><PRE>
       It  is not possible to specify special keys, such as upar­
       row, in a keyboard-independent manner.  The  only  way  to
       specify  such keys is to specify the escape sequence which
       a particular keyboard sends when such a keys is pressed.

       On MS-DOS and OS/2 systems, certain keys send  a  sequence
       of  characters which start with a NUL character (0).  This
       NUL character should be represented as \340 in  a  lesskey
       file.
