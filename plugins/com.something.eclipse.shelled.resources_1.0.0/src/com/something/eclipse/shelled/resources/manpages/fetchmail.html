<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>fetchmail</I> is a mail-retrieval and forwarding  utility;  it
       fetches  mail  from  remote mailservers and forwards it to
       your local (client) machine's delivery  system.   You  can
       then  handle  the  retrieved  mail  using normal mail user
       agents such as <B>mutt(1)</B>, <B>elm(1)</B> or <B>Mail(1)</B>.  The  <I>fetchmail</I>
       utility can be run in a daemon mode to repeatedly poll one
       or more systems at a specified interval.

       The <I>fetchmail</I> program can gather mail  from  servers  sup­
       porting  any of the common mail-retrieval protocols: POP2,
       POP3, IMAP2bis, IMAP4, and IMAPrev1.  It can also use  the
       ESMTP  ETRN  extension and ODMR.  (The RFCs describing all
       these protocols are listed  at  the  end  of  this  manual
       page.)

       While  <I>fetchmail</I> is primarily intended to be used over on-
       demand TCP/IP links (such as SLIP or PPP connections),  it
       may  also  be useful as a message transfer agent for sites
       which refuse for security reasons to permit (sender-initi­
       ated) SMTP transactions with sendmail.

       As  each  message is retrieved <I>fetchmail</I> normally delivers
       it via SMTP to port 25 on the machine  it  is  running  on
       (localhost), just as though it were being passed in over a
       normal TCP/IP link.   The  mail  will  then  be  delivered
       locally  via  your system's MDA (Mail Delivery Agent, usu­
       ally <B>sendmail(8)</B> but your system may use a  different  one
       such  as  <I>smail</I>, <I>mmdf</I>, <I>exim</I>, or <I>qmail</I>).  All the delivery-
       control  mechanisms  (such  as  <I>.forward</I>  files)  normally
       available  through  your  system  MDA  and  local delivery
       agents will therefore work.

       If no port 25 listener is available,  but  your  fetchmail
       configuration was told about a reliable local MDA, it will
       use that MDA for local delivery instead.  At  build  time,
       fetchmail  normally  looks  for executable <B>procmail(1)</B> and
       <B>sendmail(1)</B> binaries.

       If the program <I>fetchmailconf</I> is available, it will  assist
       you in setting up and editing a fetchmailrc configuration.
       It runs under X and requires that the language Python  and
       the  Tk  toolkit  be  present  on your system.  If you are
       first setting up fetchmail for  single-user  mode,  it  is
       recommended  that  you  use Novice mode.  Expert mode pro­
       Each server name that you specify following the options on
       the  command  line  will be queried.  If you don't specify
       any servers on the command line, each `poll' entry in your
       <I>~/.fetchmailrc</I> file will be queried.

       To   facilitate  the  use  of  <I>fetchmail</I>  in  scripts  and
       pipelines, it returns an appropriate exit code upon termi­
       nation -- see EXIT CODES below.

       The  following  options  modify the behavior of <I>fetchmail</I>.
       It is seldom necessary to specify any of  these  once  you
       have a working <I>.fetchmailrc</I> file set up.

       Almost  all options have a corresponding keyword which can
       be used to declare them in a <I>.fetchmailrc</I> file.

       Some special options are not covered here, but  are  docu­
       mented  instead  in  sections on AUTHENTICATION and DAEMON
       MODE which follow.

   <B>General</B> <B>Options</B>
       <B>-V</B> <B>|</B> <B>--version</B>
              Displays the version information for your  copy  of
              <I>fetchmail</I>.   No  mail fetch is performed.  Instead,
              for each server specified, all the option  informa­
              tion  that would be computed if <I>fetchmail</I> were con­
              necting to that  server  is  displayed.   Any  non-
              printables  in  passwords or other string names are
              shown as backslashed C-like escape sequences.  This
              option  is  useful  for verifying that your options
              are set the way you want them.

       <B>-c</B> <B>|</B> <B>--check</B>
              Return a status code to indicate whether  there  is
              mail waiting, without actually fetching or deleting
              mail (see EXIT CODES below).  This option turns off
              daemon  mode  (in  which  it would be useless).  It
              doesn't play well with queries to  multiple  sites,
              and doesn't work with ETRN or ODMR.  It will return
              a false positive if you leave  read  but  undeleted
              mail in your server mailbox and your fetch protocol
              can't tell kept messages from new ones.  This means
              it will work with IMAP, not work with POP2, and may
              occasionally flake out under POP3.

       <B>-s</B> <B>|</B> <B>--silent</B>
              Silent mode.  Suppresses all  progress/status  mes­
              sages  that  are  normally echoed to standard error
              during a fetch (but does not suppress actual  error
              messages).  The --verbose option overrides this.

       <B>-v</B> <B>|</B> <B>--verbose</B>
              with ETRN or ODMR.

       <B>-k</B> <B>|</B> <B>--keep</B>
              (Keyword: keep)  Keep  retrieved  messages  on  the
              remote  mailserver.  Normally, messages are deleted
              from the folder on the mailserver after  they  have
              been  retrieved.  Specifying the <B>keep</B> option causes
              retrieved messages to remain in your folder on  the
              mailserver.  This option does not work with ETRN or
              ODMR.

       <B>-K</B> <B>|</B> <B>--nokeep</B>
              (Keyword: nokeep) Delete  retrieved  messages  from
              the   remote   mailserver.    This   option  forces
              retrieved mail to be deleted.  It may be useful  if
              you  have  specified  a  default  of  <B>keep</B>  in your
              <I>.fetchmailrc</I>.  This option is forced on  with  ETRN
              and ODMR.

       <B>-F</B> <B>|</B> <B>--flush</B>
              POP3/IMAP  only.  Delete old (previously retrieved)
              messages from the mailserver before retrieving  new
              messages.  This  option  does not work with ETRN or
              ODMR.  Warning: if your local MTA hangs and  fetch­
              mail  is  aborted, the next time you run fetchmail,
              it will delete mail that  was  never  delivered  to
              you.   What  you  probably want is the default set­
              ting: if you don't  specify  `-k',  then  fetchmail
              will automatically delete messages after successful
              delivery.

   <B>Protocol</B> <B>and</B> <B>Query</B> <B>Options</B>
       <B>-p</B> <B>&lt;proto&gt;</B> <B>|</B> <B>--protocol</B> <B>&lt;proto&gt;</B>
              (Keyword: proto[col]) Specify the protocol  to  use
              when  communicating with the remote mailserver.  If
              no protocol is  specified,  the  default  is  AUTO.
              <I>proto</I> may be one of the following:

              AUTO   Tries  IMAP, POP3, and POP2 (skipping any of
                     these for which support has  not  been  com­
                     piled in).

              POP2   Post Office Protocol 2

              POP3   Post Office Protocol 3

              APOP   Use  POP3  with  old-fashioned MD5-challenge
                     authentication.

              RPOP   Use POP3 with RPOP authentication.

              KPOP   Use POP3 with Kerberos V4 authentication  on

       (communicating  with standard server daemons to fetch mail
       already delivered to a mailbox on the server) except  ETRN
       and  ODMR.   The  ETRN  mode allows you to ask a compliant
       ESMTP server (such as BSD sendmail  at  release  8.8.0  or
       higher)  to  immediately  open a sender-SMTP connection to
       your  client  machine  and  begin  forwarding  any   items
       addressed  to your client machine in the server's queue of
       undelivered mail.   The ODMR mode requires an ODMR-capable
       server  and  works  similarly to ETRN, except that it does
       not require the client machine to have a static DNS.

       <B>-U</B> <B>|</B> <B>--uidl</B>
              (Keyword: uidl) Force UIDL use (effective only with
              POP3).   Force client-side tracking of `newness' of
              messages (UIDL stands for ``unique ID listing'' and
              is described in RFC1725).  Use with `keep' to use a
              mailbox as a baby news drop for a group  of  users.
              The  fact that seen messages are skipped is logged,
              unless error logging is done through  syslog  while
              running in daemon mode.


       <B>-P</B> <B>&lt;portnumber&gt;</B> <B>|</B> <B>--port</B> <B>&lt;portnumber&gt;</B>
              (Keyword:  port)  The  port  option  permits you to
              specify a TCP/IP port to connect on.   This  option
              will  seldom be necessary as all the supported pro­
              tocols have well-established default port  numbers.

       <B>--principal</B> <B>&lt;principal&gt;</B>
              (Keyword:  principal)  The principal option permits
              you to  specify  a  service  principal  for  mutual
              authentication.  This is applicable to POP3 or IMAP
              with Kerberos authentication.

       <B>-t</B> <B>&lt;seconds&gt;</B> <B>|</B> <B>--timeout</B> <B>&lt;seconds&gt;</B>
              (Keyword: timeout) The timeout option allows you to
              set  a server-nonresponse timeout in seconds.  If a
              mailserver does not  send  a  greeting  message  or
              respond  to  commands  for the given number of sec­
              onds, <I>fetchmail</I> will hang up on it.  Without such a
              timeout <I>fetchmail</I> might hang up indefinitely trying
              to fetch mail from a down host.  This would be par­
              ticularly annoying for a <I>fetchmail</I> running in back­
              ground.  There is a default timeout which fetchmail
              -V will report.  If a given connection receives too
              many timeouts in succession,  fetchmail  will  con­
              sider it wedged and stop retrying, the calling user
              will be notified by email if this happens.

       <B>--plugin</B> <B>&lt;command&gt;</B>
              (Keyword: plugin) The plugin option allows  you  to
              use  an  external program to establish the TCP con­
              tions  (which  will probably not need it, so it has
              been separated from plugin).

       <B>-r</B> <B>&lt;name&gt;</B> <B>|</B> <B>--folder</B> <B>&lt;name&gt;</B>
              (Keyword: folder[s]) Causes a specified non-default
              mail  folder  on the mailserver (or comma-separated
              list of folders) to be retrieved.   The  syntax  of
              the  folder  name is server-dependent.  This option
              is not available under POP3, ETRN, or ODMR.

       <B>--tracepolls</B>
              (Keyword: tracepolls) Tell fetchail to  poll  trace
              information  in the form `polling %s account %s' to
              the Received line it generates, where the %s  parts
              are replaced by the user's remote name and the poll
              label (the Received header also  normally  includes
              the  server's  truename).   This  can  be  used  to
              facilate mail filtering based on the account it  is
              being received from.

       <B>--ssl</B>  (Keyword:  ssl)  Causes  the connection to the mail
              server to be encrypted via  SSL.   Connect  to  the
              server  using  the  specified  base protocol over a
              connection secured by SSL.   SSL  support  must  be
              present  at  the  server.  If no port is specified,
              the connection is attempted to the well known  port
              of  the  SSL version of the base protocol.  This is
              generally a different port than the  port  used  by
              the  base protocol.  For IMAP, this is port 143 for
              the clear protocol and port 993 for the SSL secured
              protocol.

       <B>--sslcert</B> <B>&lt;name&gt;</B>
              (Keyword:  sslcert)  Specifies the file name of the
              client  side  public  SSL  certificate.   Some  SSL
              encrypted  servers may require client side keys and
              certificates for authentication.   In  most  cases,
              this  is  optional.  This specifies the location of
              the public key certificate to be presented  to  the
              server  at the time the SSL session is established.
              It is not required (but may  be  provided)  if  the
              server  does  not  require  it.   Some  servers may
              require it, some servers may  request  it  but  not
              require  it, and some servers may not request it at
              all.  It may be the same file as  the  private  key
              (combined key and certificate file) but this is not
              recommended.

       <B>--sslkey</B> <B>&lt;name&gt;</B>
              (Keyword: sslkey) Specifies the file  name  of  the
              client  side  private  SSL key.  Some SSL encrypted
              servers may require client side keys  and  certifi­

       <B>--sslproto</B> <B>&lt;name&gt;</B>
              (Keyword: sslproto) Forces an ssl protocol.  Possi­
              ble  values are `<B>ssl2</B>', `<B>ssl3</B>' and `<B>tls1</B>'. Try this
              if the default handshake does  not  work  for  your
              server.

       <B>--sslcertck</B>
              (Keyword:  sslcertck)  Causes fetchmail to strictly
              check the server certificate against a set of local
              trusted  certificates (see the <B>sslcertpath</B> option).
              If the server certificate is not signed by  one  of
              the  trusted ones (directly or indirectly), the SSL
              connection will fail. This checking should  prevent
              man-in-the-middle  attacks  against the SSL connec­
              tion. Note that CRLs are  seemingly  not  currently
              supported  by  OpenSSL in certificate verification!
              Your system clock  should  be  reasonably  accurate
              when using this option!

       <B>--sslcertpath</B> <B>&lt;directory&gt;</B>
              (Keyword: sslcertpath) Sets the directory fetchmail
              uses to look up local certificates. The default  is
              your  OpenSSL  default  one.  The directory must be
              hashed as OpenSSL expects it - every time  you  add
              or  modify a certificate in the directory, you need
              to use the <B>c_rehash</B> tool (which comes with  OpenSSL
              in the tools/ subdirectory).

       <B>--sslfingerprint</B>
              (Keyword:  sslfingerprint)  Specify the fingerprint
              of the server key (an MD5 hash of the key) in  hex­
              adecimal  notation with colons separating groups of
              two digits. The letter hex digits must be in  upper
              case.  This is the default format OpenSSL uses, and
              the one fetchmail uses to  report  the  fingerprint
              when an SSL connection is established. When this is
              specified, fetchmail will compare  the  server  key
              fingerprint  with the given one, and the connection
              will fail if they do not match. This can be used to
              prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

   <B>Delivery</B> <B>Control</B> <B>Options</B>
       <B>-S</B> <B>&lt;hosts&gt;</B> <B>|</B> <B>--smtphost</B> <B>&lt;hosts&gt;</B>
              (Keyword:  smtp[host]) Specify a hunt list of hosts
              to forward mail to (one or more  hostnames,  comma-
              separated).  Hosts  are  tried  in  list order; the
              first one that is up becomes the forwarding  target
              for  the  current  run.   Normally,  `localhost' is
              added to the  end  of  the  list  as  an  invisible
              default.   However, when using Kerberos authentica­
              tion, the FQDN of the machine running fetchmail  is
              or LMTP receiver.

       <B>--fetchdomains</B> <B>&lt;hosts&gt;</B>
              (Keyword:  fetchdomains) In ETRN or ODMR mode, this
              option specifies the list  of  domains  the  server
              should  ship mail for once the connection is turned
              around.  The default is the  FQDN  of  the  machine
              running <I>fetchmail</I>.

       <B>-D</B> <B>&lt;domain&gt;</B> <B>|</B> <B>--smtpaddress</B> <B>&lt;domain&gt;</B>
              (Keyword:  smtpaddress)  Specify  the  domain to be
              appended to addresses in RCPT TO lines  shipped  to
              SMTP.  The name of the SMTP server (as specified by
              --smtphost, or defaulted to  "localhost")  is  used
              when this is not specified.

       <B>--smtpname</B> <B>&lt;user@domain&gt;</B>
              (Keyword:  smtpname) Specify the domain and user to
              be put in RCPT  TO  lines  shipped  to  SMTP.   The
              default user is the current local user.

       <B>-Z</B> <B>&lt;nnn&gt;</B> <B>|</B> <B>--antispam</B> <B>&lt;nnn[,</B> <B>nnn]...&gt;</B>
              (Keyword:  antispam)  Specifies the list of numeric
              SMTP errors that are to be interpreted as  a  spam-
              block  response  from  the listener.  A value of -1
              disables this option.  For the command-line option,
              the list values should be comma-separated.

       <B>-m</B> <B>&lt;command&gt;</B> <B>|</B> <B>--mda</B> <B>&lt;command&gt;</B>
              (Keyword:  mda)  You can force mail to be passed to
              an MDA directly (rather than forwarded to port  25)
              with the --mda or -m option.  To avoid losing mail,
              use this option only with  MDAs  like  procmail  or
              sendmail  that return a nonzero status on disk-full
              and other resource-exhaustion errors;  the  nonzero
              status  tells  fetchmail  that  delivery failed and
              prevents the message from  being  deleted  off  the
              server.   If  <I>fetchmail</I> is running as root, it sets
              its userid to that of the target user while  deliv­
              ering  mail through an MDA.  Some possible MDAs are
              "/usr/sbin/sendmail     -i     -f      %F      %T",
              "/usr/bin/deliver"  and  "/usr/bin/procmail  -d %T"
              (but the latter is usually redundant as  it's  what
              SMTP  listeners normally forward to).  Local deliv­
              ery addresses will be inserted into the MDA command
              wherever  you  place  a %T; the mail message's From
              address will be inserted where you place an %F.  Do
              <I>not</I>  use  an  MDA  invocation like "sendmail -i -t"
              that dispatches on the contents  of  To/Cc/Bcc,  it
              will  create mail loops and bring the just wrath of
              many postmasters down upon your head.

              MAIL  FROM and RCPT TO lines is not guaranteed cor­
              rect; the caveats discussed under THE USE AND ABUSE
              OF MULTIDROP MAILBOXES below apply.

   <B>Resource</B> <B>Limit</B> <B>Control</B> <B>Options</B>
       <B>-l</B> <B>&lt;maxbytes&gt;</B> <B>|</B> <B>--limit</B> <B>&lt;maxbytes&gt;</B>
              (Keyword:  limit)  Takes a maximum octet size argu­
              ment.  Messages larger than this size will  not  be
              fetched  and  will  be left on the server (in fore­
              ground sessions, the progress  messages  will  note
              that  they are "oversized").  If the fetch protocol
              permits (in particular, under IMAP or POP3  without
              the fetchall option) the message will not be marked
              seen An explicit --limit of 0 overrides any  limits
              set  in  your  run  control  file.  This  option is
              intended for  those  needing  to  strictly  control
              fetch  time  due  to  expensive  and variable phone
              rates.  In daemon mode, oversize notifications  are
              mailed  to  the  calling  user  (see the --warnings
              option).  This option does not work  with  ETRN  or
              ODMR.

       <B>-w</B> <B>&lt;interval&gt;</B> <B>|</B> <B>--warnings</B> <B>&lt;interval&gt;</B>
              (Keyword:  warnings)  Takes an interval in seconds.
              When you call <I>fetchmail</I> with a  `limit'  option  in
              daemon  mode,  this  controls the interval at which
              warnings about oversized messages are mailed to the
              calling  user  (or the user specified by the `post­
              master' option).  One such notification  is  always
              mailed  at  the  end of the the first poll that the
              oversized message is detected.  Thereafter, renoti­
              fication  is  suppressed  until  after  the warning
              interval elapses (it will take place at the end  of
              the first following poll).

       <B>-b</B> <B>&lt;count&gt;</B> <B>|</B> <B>--batchlimit</B> <B>&lt;count&gt;</B>
              (Keyword: batchlimit) Specify the maximum number of
              messages that will be shipped to an  SMTP  listener
              before the connection is deliberately torn down and
              rebuilt (defaults to  0,  meaning  no  limit).   An
              explicit --batchlimit of 0 overrides any limits set
              in your run control file.  While  <B>sendmail(8)</B>  nor­
              mally  initiates  delivery of a message immediately
              after receiving the message terminator,  some  SMTP
              listeners  are  not  so prompt.  MTAs like <B>smail(8)</B>
              may wait till the delivery socket is shut  down  to
              deliver.   This  may  produce  annoying delays when
              <I>fetchmail</I> is processing very large  batches.   Set­
              ting the batch limit to some nonzero size will pre­
              vent these delays.  This option does not work  with
              ETRN or ODMR.

              ing QUIT after each sub-session.  This  is  a  good
              defense  against line drops on POP3 servers that do
              not do the equivalent of a QUIT on  hangup.   Under
              IMAP,  <I>fetchmail</I> normally issues an EXPUNGE command
              after each deletion in order to force the  deletion
              to  be  done immediately.  This is safest when your
              connection to the server is flaky and expensive, as
              it  avoids  resending  duplicate  mail after a line
              hit.  However, on large mailboxes the  overhead  of
              re-indexing after every message can slam the server
              pretty hard, so if your connection is  reliable  it
              is  good to do expunges less frequently.  Also note
              that some servers enforce a delay of a few  seconds
              after  each  quit,  so fetchmail may not be able to
              get back in immediately after an expunge -- you may
              see  "lock  busy"  errors  if  this happens. If you
              specify this option  to  an  integer  N,  it  tells
              <I>fetchmail</I>  to  only  issue  expunges  on  every Nth
              delete.  An argument of  zero  suppresses  expunges
              entirely  (so no expunges at all will be done until
              the end of run).  This option does  not  work  with
              ETRN or ODMR.

   <B>Authentication</B> <B>Options</B>
       <B>-u</B> <B>&lt;name&gt;</B> <B>|</B> <B>--username</B> <B>&lt;name&gt;</B>
              (Keyword:  user[name]) Specifies the user identifi­
              cation  to  be  used  when  logging   in   to   the
              mailserver.  The appropriate user identification is
              both server and  user-dependent.   The  default  is
              your  login name on the client machine that is run­
              ning <I>fetchmail</I>.  See USER AUTHENTICATION below  for
              a complete description.

       <B>-I</B> <B>&lt;specification&gt;</B> <B>|</B> <B>--interface</B> <B>&lt;specification&gt;</B>
              (Keyword: interface) Require that a specific inter­
              face device be up and  have  a  specific  local  or
              remote  IP address (or range) before polling.  Fre­
              quently <I>fetchmail</I> is used over a  transient  point-
              to-point  TCP/IP  link  established  directly  to a
              mailserver via SLIP or PPP.  That is  a  relatively
              secure  channel.   But  when other TCP/IP routes to
              the mailserver exist (e.g. when the  link  is  con­
              nected  to  an  alternate  ISP),  your username and
              password may be vulnerable to snooping  (especially
              when  daemon  mode  automatically  polls  for mail,
              shipping a clear password  over  the  net  at  pre­
              dictable intervals).  The --interface option may be
              used to prevent this.  When the specified  link  is
              not  up  or  is  not  connected  to  a  matching IP
              address, polling will be skipped.  The format is:

                   interface/iii.iii.iii.iii/mmm.mmm.mmm.mmm

              links which are automatically taken  down  after  a
              period  of inactivity (e.g. PPP links) to remain up
              indefinitely.   This  option  identifies  a  system
              TCP/IP  interface  to  be  monitored  for activity.
              After each poll interval, if the link is up but  no
              other  activity  has occurred on the link, then the
              poll will be skipped.  However, when  fetchmail  is
              woken  up by a signal, the monitor check is skipped
              and the poll goes  through  unconditionally.   This
              option  is currently only supported under Linux and
              FreeBSD.  For the <B>monitor</B> and <B>interface</B> options  to
              work  for  non root users under FreeBSD, the fetch­
              mail binary must be installed SGID kmem. This would
              be  a  security  hole,  but fetchmail runs with the
              effective GID set to that of the  kmem  group  <I>only</I>
              when interface data is being collected.

       <B>--auth</B> <B>&lt;type&gt;</B>
              (Keyword:  auth[enticate])  This option permits you
              to specify an authentication type (see USER AUTHEN­
              TICATION  below  for details).  The possible values
              are <B>any</B>, `<B>password</B>', `<B>kerberos_v5</B>'  and  `<B>kerberos</B>'
              (or,  for  excruciating  exactness, `<B>kerberos_v4</B>'),
              gssapi, <I>cram-md5</I>, <I>otp</I>, <I>ntlm</I>,  and  <B>ssh</B>.   When  <B>any</B>
              (the  default)  is specified, fetchmail tries first
              methods that don't require a password (GSSAPI, KER­
              BEROS_IV); then it looks for methods that mask your
              password (CRAM-MD5, X-OTP, NTLM); and only  if  the
              server  doesn't  support  any of those will it ship
              your password en clair.  Other values may  be  used
              to  force  various authentication methods (<B>ssh</B> sup­
              presses  authentication).   Any  value  other  than
              <I>password</I>,  <I>cram-md5</I>,  <I>ntlm</I> or <I>otp</I> suppresses fetch­
              mail's normal inquiry for a password.  Specify  <I>ssh</I>
              when  you are using an end-to-end secure connection
              such as an  ssh  tunnel;  specify  gssapi  or  <B>ker­</B>
              <B>beros_v4</B>  if  you are using a protocol variant that
              employs GSSAPI or K4.  Choosing KPOP protocol auto­
              matically  selects  Kerberos  authentication.  This
              option does not work with ETRN.

   <B>Miscellaneous</B> <B>Options</B>
       <B>-f</B> <B>&lt;pathname&gt;</B> <B>|</B> <B>--fetchmailrc</B> <B>&lt;pathname&gt;</B>
              Specify a non-default name for  the  <I>~/.fetchmailrc</I>
              run  control  file.   The pathname argument must be
              either "-" (a single dash, meaning to read the con­
              figuration  from  standard  input)  or  a filename.
              Unless the --version option is  also  on,  a  named
              file  argument  must  have permissions no more open
              than 0600 (u=rw,g=,o=) or else be /dev/null.

       <B>-i</B> <B>&lt;pathname&gt;</B> <B>|</B> <B>--idfile</B> <B>&lt;pathname&gt;</B>
              paranoid  about having an MTA edit mail headers and
              want to know they can prevent it, but it is  gener­
              ally not a good idea to actually turn off rewrite.)
              When using ETRN or  ODMR,  the  rewrite  option  is
              ineffective.

       <B>-E</B> <B>&lt;line&gt;</B> <B>|</B> <B>--envelope</B> <B>&lt;line&gt;</B>
              (Keyword:  envelope) This option changes the header
              <I>fetchmail</I> assumes will carry a copy of  the  mail's
              envelope address.  Normally this is `X-Envelope-To'
              but  as  this  header  is  not  standard,  practice
              varies.  See  the  discussion  of multidrop address
              handling  below.   As  a  special  case,  `envelope
              "Received"'   enables   parsing  of  sendmail-style
              Received lines.  This is the default, and it should
              not  be necessary unless you have globally disabled
              Received parsing with `no envelope' in the  <I>.fetch­</I>
              <I>mailrc</I> file.

       <B>-Q</B> <B>&lt;prefix&gt;</B> <B>|</B> <B>--qvirtual</B> <B>&lt;prefix&gt;</B>
              (Keyword:  qvirtual)  The string prefix assigned to
              this option will be  removed  from  the  user  name
              found  in  the  header  specified with the <I>envelope</I>
              option (<I>before</I>  doing  multidrop  name  mapping  or
              localdomain  checking,  if  either  is applicable).
              This option is useful if you are using <I>fetchmail</I> to
              collect  the mail for an entire domain and your ISP
              (or your mail redirection provider) is using qmail.
              One of the basic features of qmail is the

              `Delivered-To:'

              message  header.  Whenever qmail delivers a message
              to a local mailbox it puts the username  and  host­
              name  of  the envelope recipient on this line.  The
              major reason for this is to prevent mail loops.  To
              set  up qmail to batch mail for a disconnected site
              the ISP-mailhost will have normally put  that  site
              in its `Virtualhosts' control file so it will add a
              prefix to all mail addresses for  this  site.  This
              results  in  mail  sent to 'username@userhost.user­
              dom.dom.com' having a `Delivered-To:' line  of  the
              form:

              Delivered-To:  mbox-userstr-username@userhost.user­
              dom.dom.com

              The ISP can make the  'mbox-userstr-'  prefix  any­
              thing  they  choose  but a string matching the user
              host name is likely.  By using the option `envelope
              Delivered-To:'  you  can  make  fetchmail  reliably
              identify the original envelope recipient,  but  you


</PRE>
<H2>USER AUTHENTICATION AND ENCRYPTION</H2><PRE>
       All modes except ETRN require authentication of the client
       to the server.  Normal user authentication in <I>fetchmail</I> is
       very  much  like  the  authentication mechanism of <B>ftp(1)</B>.
       The correct user-id and password depend upon the  underly­
       ing security system at the mailserver.

       If  the  mailserver is a Unix machine on which you have an
       ordinary user account, your regular login name  and  pass­
       word  are  used with <I>fetchmail</I>.  If you use the same login
       name on both the  server  and  the  client  machines,  you
       needn't  worry  about  specifying  a  user-id  with the <B>-u</B>
       option -- the default behavior is to use your  login  name
       on  the  client  machine  as  the  user-id  on  the server
       machine.  If you use a different login name on the  server
       machine, specify that login name with the <B>-u</B> option.  e.g.
       if your login name is 'jsmith' on a machine  named  'mail­
       grunt', you would start <I>fetchmail</I> as follows:

              fetchmail -u jsmith mailgrunt

       The  default  behavior  of  <I>fetchmail</I> is to prompt you for
       your mailserver password before the connection  is  estab­
       lished.   This  is  the  safest  way  to use <I>fetchmail</I> and
       ensures that your password will not be  compromised.   You
       may  also  specify  your  password  in your <I>~/.fetchmailrc</I>
       file.  This is convenient when using <I>fetchmail</I>  in  daemon
       mode or with scripts.

       If  you  do  not  specify a password, and <I>fetchmail</I> cannot
       extract one from your <I>~/.fetchmailrc</I> file,  it  will  look
       for a <I>~/.netrc</I> file in your home directory before request­
       ing one interactively; if an entry matching the mailserver
       is  found in that file, the password will be used.  Fetch­
       mail first looks for a match on poll  name;  if  it  finds
       none,  it  checks for a match on via name.  See the <B>ftp(1)</B>
       man page for details of the syntax of the  <I>~/.netrc</I>  file.
       (This  feature may allow you to avoid duplicating password
       information in more than one file.)

       On mailservers that do not provide ordinary user accounts,
       your  user-id  and  password  are  usually assigned by the
       server administrator when you apply for a mailbox  on  the
       server.   Contact  your  server administrator if you don't
       know the correct user-id and  password  for  your  mailbox
       account.

       Early  versions  of  POP3  (RFC1081,  RFC1225) supported a
       crude form of independent authentication using the  <I>rhosts</I>
       file  on  the mailserver side.  Under this RPOP variant, a
       fixed per-user ID equivalent to a  password  was  sent  in
       clear  over  a  link  to a reserved port, with the command
       it by checking its authorization database.

       If your <I>fetchmail</I> was built with Kerberos support and  you
       specify Kerberos authentication (either with --auth or the
       <I>.fetchmailrc</I> option <B>authenticate</B> <B>kerberos_v4</B>) it will  try
       to  get a Kerberos ticket from the mailserver at the start
       of each query.  Note: if either the pollnane or  via  name
       is  `hesiod',  fetchmail will try to use Hesiod to look up
       the mailserver.

       If you use POP3 or IMAP with GSSAPI authentication, <I>fetch­</I>
       <I>mail</I>   will   expect   the  server  to  have  RFC1731-  or
       RFC1734-conformant GSSAPI capability,  and  will  use  it.
       Currently  this  has  only been tested over Kerberos V, so
       you're expected to already have a ticket-granting  ticket.
       You may pass a username different from your principal name
       using the standard <B>--user</B> command or by  the  <I>.fetchmailrc</I>
       option <B>user</B>.

       If  your  IMAP  daemon returns the PREAUTH response in its
       greeting line, fetchmail will notice  this  and  skip  the
       normal  authentication  step.  This can be useful, e.g. if
       you start imapd explicitly using ssh.  In  this  case  you
       can  declare  the  authentication value `ssh' on that site
       entry to stop <I>.fetchmail</I> from asking you  for  a  password
       when it starts up.

       If  you  are using POP3, and the server issues a one-time-
       password challenge conforming to RFC1938,  <I>fetchmail</I>  will
       use  your  password  as  a  pass  phrase  to  generate the
       required response. This avoids sending  secrets  over  the
       net unencrypted.

       Compuserve's  RPA authentication (similar to APOP) is sup­
       ported. If you compile in the support, <I>fetchmail</I> will  try
       to  perform  an  RPA pass-phrase authentication instead of
       sending over the password en clair if  it  detects  "@com­
       puserve.com" in the hostname.

       If  you  are  using  IMAP, Microsoft's NTLM authentication
       (used by Microsoft Exchange) is supported. If you  compile
       in  the  support,  <I>fetchmail</I>  will  try to perform an NTLM
       authentication (instead of sending over  the  password  en
       clair)  whenever the server returns AUTH=NTLM in its capa­
       bility response. Specify a user option  value  that  looks
       like  `user@domain': the part to the left of the @ will be
       passed as the username and the part to the  right  as  the
       NTLM domain.

       If  you  are  using IPsec, the -T (--netsec) option can be
       used to pass an IP security request to be used when outgo­
       ing  IP connections are initialized.  You can also do this

       When  connecting  to  an  SSL encrypted server, the server
       presents a certificate to the client for validation.   The
       certificate  is  checked to verify that the common name in
       the certificate matches the name of the server being  con­
       tacted  and that the effective and expiration dates in the
       certificate indicate that it is currently valid.   If  any
       of  these  checks  fail, a warning message is printed, but
       the connection continues.  The server certificate does not
       need to be signed by any specific Certifying Authority and
       may be a "self-signed" certificate.

       Some SSL encrypted servers may request a client side  cer­
       tificate.   A  client side public SSL certificate and pri­
       vate SSL key  may  be  specified.   If  requested  by  the
       server,  the  client certificate is sent to the server for
       validation.  Some servers may require a valid client  cer­
       tificate  and  may  refuse connections if a certificate is
       not provided or if the certificate  is  not  valid.   Some
       servers  may require client side certificates be signed by
       a recognized Certifying Authority.  The format for the key
       files  and  the  certificate files is that required by the
       underlying SSL libraries (OpenSSL in the general case).

       A word of care about the use of SSL: While above mentioned
       setup  with self-signed server certificates retrieved over
       the wires can protect you from a passive  eavesdropper  it
       doesn't  help  against an active attacker. It's clearly an
       improvement over sending the passwords in  clear  but  you
       should  be  aware that a man-in-the-middle attack is triv­
       ially possible (in particular with tools such  as  dsniff,
       http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/).   Use  of  an ssh
       tunnel (see below for some examples) is preferable if  you
       care seriously about the security of your mailbox.

       <B>fetchmail</B> also supports authentication to the ESMTP server
       on the client side according to RFC 2554.  You can specify
       a  name/password pair to be used with the keywords `esmtp­
       name' and `esmtppassword';  the  former  defaults  to  the
       username of the calling user.



</PRE>
<H2>DAEMON MODE</H2><PRE>
       The  <B>--daemon</B>  <B>&lt;interval&gt;</B>  or  <B>-d</B>  <B>&lt;interval&gt;</B>  option runs
       <I>fetchmail</I> in daemon mode.   You  must  specify  a  numeric
       argument which is a polling interval in seconds.

       In  daemon  mode,  <I>fetchmail</I> puts itself in background and
       runs forever, querying each specified host and then sleep­
       ing for the given polling interval.

       Simply invoking
       Only one daemon process is permitted per user;  in  daemon
       mode,  <I>fetchmail</I>  makes  a  per-user lockfile to guarantee
       this.

       Normally, calling fetchmail with a  daemon  in  the  back­
       ground  sends a wakeup signal to the daemon, forcing it to
       poll  mailservers  immediately.   (The  wakeup  signal  is
       SIGHUP  if  fetchmail  is  running as root, SIGUSR1 other­
       wise.)  The wakeup action also clears any  `wedged'  flags
       indicating  that  connections  have  wedged  due to failed
       authentication or multiple timeouts.

       The option <B>--quit</B>  will  kill  a  running  daemon  process
       instead  of  waking  it  up  (if there is no such process,
       <I>fetchmail</I> notifies you).  If the --quit option is the only
       command-line option, that's all there is to it.

       The  quit option may also be mixed with other command-line
       options; its effect is to kill any running  daemon  before
       doing  what  the other options specify in combination with
       the rc file.

       The <B>-L</B> <B>&lt;filename&gt;</B> or <B>--logfile</B> <B>&lt;filename&gt;</B> option (keyword:
       set  logfile) allows you to redirect status messages emit­
       ted while detached into a specified  logfile  (follow  the
       option  with the logfile name).  The logfile is opened for
       append, so previous messages aren't deleted.  This is pri­
       marily useful for debugging configurations.

       The  <B>--syslog</B>  option  (keyword: set syslog) allows you to
       redirect status and error messages  emitted  to  the  <I>sys­</I>
       <B>log(3)</B>  system  daemon  if available.  Messages are logged
       with an id of <B>fetchmail</B>, the facility <B>LOG_MAIL</B>, and prior­
       ities  <B>LOG_ERR</B>,  <B>LOG_ALERT</B>  or  <B>LOG_INFO</B>.   This option is
       intended for logging status and error messages which indi­
       cate the status of the daemon and the results while fetch­
       ing mail from the server(s).  Error messages  for  command
       line  options  and parsing the <I>.fetchmailrc</I> file are still
       written to stderr, or to  the  specified  log  file.   The
       <B>--nosyslog</B>  option  turns  off  use of <B>syslog(3)</B>, assuming
       it's turned on in the <I>~/.fetchmailrc</I> file, or that the  <B>-L</B>
       or <B>--logfile</B> <B>&lt;file&gt;</B> option was used.

       The  <B>-N</B>  or --nodetach option suppresses backgrounding and
       detachment of the daemon process from its  control  termi­
       nal.   This  is primarily useful for debugging.  Note that
       this also causes the logfile option to be ignored  (though
       perhaps it shouldn't).

       Note  that  while running in daemon mode polling a POP2 or
       IMAP2bis server, transient errors (such as DNS failures or
       sendmail  delivery refusals) may force the fetchall option
       break the <I>~/.fetchmailrc</I> file's syntax, the  new  instance
       will softly and silently vanish away on startup.



</PRE>
<H2>ADMINISTRATIVE OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The  <B>--postmaster</B>  <B>&lt;name&gt;</B> option (keyword: set postmaster)
       specifies the last-resort username to which multidrop mail
       is  to  be forwarded if no matching local recipient can be
       found.  Normally this is just the user who invoked  <I>fetch­</I>
       <I>mail</I>.   If  the invoking user is root, then the default of
       this option is the user `postmaster'.  Setting  postmaster
       to the empty string causes such mail to be discarded.

       The  <B>--nobounce</B>  option  suppresses  the  normal action of
       bouncing errors back to the sender in  an  RFC1894-confor­
       mant  error  message.  If nobounce is on, the message will
       go to the postmaster instead.

       The <B>--invisible</B> option (keyword: set invisible)  tries  to
       make  fetchmail  invisible.   Normally,  fetchmail behaves
       like any other MTA would -- it generates a Received header
       into  each  message  describing  its place in the chain of
       transmission, and tells the MTA it forwards  to  that  the
       mail came from the machine fetchmail itself is running on.
       If the invisible option is on, the Received header is sup­
       pressed  and  fetchmail tries to spoof the MTA it forwards
       to into thinking it  came  directly  from  the  mailserver
       host.

       The  <B>--showdots</B>  option  (keyword:  set  showdots)  forces
       fetchmail to show progress dots even if the current tty is
       not  stdout  (for example logfiles).  Starting with fetch­
       mail version 5.3.0, progress dots are only shown on stdout
       by default.

       By  specifying the <B>--tracepolls</B> option, you can ask fetch­
       mail to add information to the Received header on the form
       "polling  {label}  account  {user}",  where {label} is the
       account  label  (from  the  specified   rcfile,   normally
       ~/.fetchmailrc)  and  {user} is the username which is used
       to log on to the mail server. This header can be  used  to
       make filtering email where no useful header information is
       available and you want mail from different accounts sorted
       into  different  mailboxes (this could, for example, occur
       if you have an account on the same server running a  mail­
       ing  list,  and  are  subscribed  to  the  list using that
       account). The default is not adding any such  header.   In
       <I>.fetchmailrc</I>, this is called `tracepolls'.



</PRE>
<H2>RETRIEVAL FAILURE MODES</H2><PRE>
       The  protocols  <I>fetchmail</I>  uses to talk to mailservers are
       ment and can be used with the mda option with no  risk  of
       mail  loss.   Unsafe  MDAs,  though,  may return 0 even on
       delivery failure.  If this happens, you will lose mail.

       The normal mode of <I>fetchmail</I> is to try  to  download  only
       `new' messages, leaving untouched (and undeleted) messages
       you have already read directly on the server  (or  fetched
       with  a previous <I>fetchmail</I> <I>--keep</I>).  But you may find that
       messages you've already  read  on  the  server  are  being
       fetched  (and  deleted) even when you don't specify --all.
       There are several reasons this can happen.

       One could be that you're using POP2.   The  POP2  protocol
       includes no representation of `new' or `old' state in mes­
       sages, so <I>fetchmail</I> must treat all messages as new all the
       time.  But POP2 is obsolete, so this is unlikely.

       Under  POP3, blame RFC1725.  That version of the POP3 pro­
       tocol specification removed the LAST command, and some POP
       servers  follow it (you can verify this by invoking <I>fetch­</I>
       <I>mail</I> <I>-v</I> to the mailserver and  watching  the  response  to
       LAST  early  in  the  query).  The <I>fetchmail</I> code tries to
       compensate by using POP3's UID feature, storing the  iden­
       tifiers  of  messages  seen in each session until the next
       session, in the <I>.fetchids</I> file.  But  this  doesn't  track
       messages  seen with other clients, or read directly with a
       mailer on the host but not deleted  afterward.   A  better
       solution would be to switch to IMAP.

       Another  potential  POP3  problem  might  be  servers that
       insert messages in  the  middle  of  mailboxes  (some  VMS
       implementations  of  mail  are  rumored  to do this).  The
       <I>fetchmail</I> code assumes that new messages are  appended  to
       the end of the mailbox; when this is not true it may treat
       some old messages as new and vice versa.   The  only  real
       fix for this problem is to  switch to IMAP.

       Yet  another POP3 problem is that if they can't make temp­
       files in the user's home directory, some POP3 servers will
       hand  back  an undocumented response that causes fetchmail
       to spuriously report "No mail".

       The IMAP code uses the presence or absence of  the  server
       flag  \Seen  to  decide  whether  or not a message is new.
       Under Unix, it counts on your IMAP server  to  notice  the
       BSD-style Status flags set by mail user agents and set the
       \Seen flag from them  when  appropriate.   All  Unix  IMAP
       servers  we  know of do this, though it's not specified by
       the IMAP RFCs.  If  you  ever  trip  over  a  server  that
       doesn't,  the  symptom  will  be  that  messages  you have
       already read on your host will look new to the server.  In
       this  (unlikely)  case,  only  messages  you  fetched with

       Newer  versions  of  <I>sendmail</I> return an error code of 571.
       This return value is blessed by RFC1893 as  "Delivery  not
       authorized, message refused".

       According  to RFC2821, the correct thing to return in this
       situation is 550  "Requested  action  not  taken:  mailbox
       unavailable" (the draft adds "[E.g., mailbox not found, no
       access, or command rejected for policy reasons].").

       Older versions of the <I>exim</I> MTA return 501 "Syntax error in
       parameters or arguments".

       The <I>postfix</I> MTA runs 554 as an antispam response.

       <I>Zmailer</I>  may  reject code with a 500 response (followed by
       an enhanced status code that contains more information).

       Return codes which <I>fetchmail</I> treats as antispam  responses
       and  discards  the  message can be set with the `antispam'
       option.  This is one of the <I>only</I> three circumstance  under
       which fetchmail ever discards mail (the others are the 552
       and 553 errors described below,  and  the  suppression  of
       multidropped messages with a message-ID already seen).

       If <I>fetchmail</I> is fetching from an IMAP server, the antispam
       response will be detected and the message rejected immedi­
       ately after the headers have been fetched, without reading
       the message body.  Thus, you  won't  pay  for  downloading
       spam message bodies.

       By default, the list of antispam responses is empty.

       If  the <I>spambounce</I> option is on, mail that is spam-blocked
       triggers an RFC1892 bounce message informing the  origina­
       tor that we do not accept mail from it.



</PRE>
<H2>SMTP/ESMTP ERROR HANDLING</H2><PRE>
       Besides the spam-blocking described above, fetchmail takes
       special  actions  on  the   following   SMTP/ESMTP   error
       responses

       452 (insufficient system storage)
            Leave  the  message  in  the server mailbox for later
            retrieval.

       552 (message exceeds fixed maximum message size)
            Delete the message from the server.  Send bounce-mail
            to the originator.

       553 (invalid sending domain)
       To  protect the security of your passwords, when --version
       is not on your <I>~/.fetchmailrc</I> may not have more than  0600
       (u=rw,g=,o=) permissions; <I>fetchmail</I> will complain and exit
       otherwise.

       You may read the <I>.fetchmailrc</I> file as a list  of  commands
       to be executed when <I>fetchmail</I> is called with no arguments.

   <B>Run</B> <B>Control</B> <B>Syntax</B>
       Comments begin with a '#' and extend through  the  end  of
       the  line.   Otherwise  the  file  consists of a series of
       server entries or global option statements in a  free-for­
       mat, token-oriented syntax.

       There  are four kinds of tokens: grammar keywords, numbers
       (i.e. decimal  digit  sequences),  unquoted  strings,  and
       quoted  strings.   A  quoted  string  is bounded by double
       quotes and may contain whitespace (and quoted  digits  are
       treated  as  a string).  An unquoted string is any whites­
       pace-delimited  token  that  is  neither  numeric,  string
       quoted  nor contains the special characters `,', `;', `:',
       or `='.

       Any  amount  of  whitespace  separates  tokens  in  server
       entries, but is otherwise ignored. You may use standard C-
       style escapes (\n, \t, \b, octal, and hex) to  embed  non-
       printable characters or string delimiters in strings.

       Each  server  entry consists of one of the keywords `poll'
       or `skip', followed by a server name, followed  by  server
       options,  followed  by  any  number  of user descriptions.
       Note: the most common cause of syntax errors is mixing  up
       user and server options.

       For backward compatibility, the word `server' is a synonym
       for `poll'.

       You can use  the  noise  keywords  `and',  `with',  `has',
       `wants',  and  `options'  anywhere  in an entry to make it
       resemble English.   They're  ignored,  but  but  can  make
       entries  much easier to read at a glance.  The punctuation
       characters ':', ';' and ',' are also ignored.


   <B>Poll</B> <B>vs.</B> <B>Skip</B>
       The `poll' verb tells fetchmail to query this host when it
       is run with no arguments.  The `skip' verb tells <I>fetchmail</I>
       not to poll this host unless it is explicitly named on the
       command  line.   (The `skip' verb allows you to experiment
       with test entries safely, or easily  disable  entries  for
       hosts that are temporarily down.)

       In  the  .fetchmailrc file, the `envelope' string argument
       may be preceded by a  whitespace-separated  number.   This
       number,  if  specified,  is  the number of such headers to
       skip (that is, an argument of 1 selects the second  header
       of  the given type).  This is sometime useful for ignoring
       bogus Received headers created by an ISP's local  delivery
       agent.

       The `folder' and `smtphost' options (unlike their command-
       line equivalents) can take  a  space-  or  comma-separated
       list of names following them.

       All  options  correspond to the obvious command-line argu­
       ments, except the  following:  `via',  `interval',  `aka',

       The `interval' option (which  takes  a  numeric  argument)
       allows you to poll a server less frequently than the basic
       poll interval.  If you say `interval N'  the  server  this
       option  is  attached  to will only be queried every N poll
       intervals.

       The `is' or `to' keywords associate  the  following  local
       (client)  name(s)  (or server-name to client-name mappings
       separated by =) with  the  mailserver  user  name  in  the
       entry.   If an is/to list has `*' as its last name, unrec­
       ognized names are simply passed through.

       A single local name can be  used  to  support  redirecting
       your mail when your username on the client machine is dif­
       ferent from your name on the mailserver.   When  there  is
       only  a single local name, mail is forwarded to that local
       username regardless of the message's Received, To, Cc, and
       Bcc  headers.   In  this  case  <I>fetchmail</I>  never  does DNS
       lookups.

       When there is more than one local name (or  name  mapping)
       the  <I>fetchmail</I> code does look at the Received, To, Cc, and
       Bcc headers of retrieved mail (this is `multidrop  mode').
       It looks for addresses with hostname parts that match your
       poll name or your `via', `aka' or `localdomains'  options,
       and usually also for hostname parts which DNS tells it are
       aliases of the mailserver.  See the discussion  of  `dns',
       `checkalias', `localdomains', and `aka' for details on how
       matching addresses are handled.

       If <I>fetchmail</I> cannot  match  any  mailserver  usernames  or
       localdomain addresses, the mail will be bounced.  Normally
       it will be bounced to the sender, but if `nobounce' is  on
       it  will  go  to the postmaster (which in turn defaults to
       being the calling user).

       The `dns' option (normally on) controls the way  addresses
       from  multidrop  mailboxes  are  checked.   On, it enables
       logic to check each host address  that  doesn't  match  an
       `aka'  or `localdomains' declaration by looking it up with
       DNS.  When a mailserver username is recognized attached to
       a  matching  hostname  part, its local mapping is added to
       the list of local recipients.

       The `checkalias' option (normally off) extends the lookups
       performed  by the `dns' keyword in multidrop mode, provid­
       ing a way to cope with remote  MTAs  that  identify  them­
       selves  using  their  canonical name, while they're polled
       using an alias.  When such a server is polled,  checks  to
       extract  the  envelope address fail, and <I>fetchmail</I> reverts
       to delivery using the To/Cc/Bcc headers (See below `Header
       for names of the mailserver, pre-declaring common ones can
       save it from having to do DNS lookups.   Note:  the  names
       you  give as arguments to `aka' are matched as suffixes --
       if you specify (say) `aka netaxs.com', this will match not
       just  a  hostnamed  netaxs.com, but any hostname that ends
       with `.netaxs.com';  such  as  (say)  pop3.netaxs.com  and
       mail.netaxs.com.

       The  `localdomains' option allows you to declare a list of
       domains  which  fetchmail  should  consider  local.   When
       fetchmail is parsing address lines in multidrop modes, and
       a trailing segment of a host name matches a declared local
       domain,  that address is passed through to the listener or
       MDA unaltered (local-name mappings are <I>not</I> applied).

       If you are using `localdomains',  you  may  also  need  to
       specify  `no  envelope', which disables <I>fetchmail</I>'s normal
       attempt to deduce an envelope address  from  the  Received
       line  or  X-Envelope-To header or whatever header has been
       previously set by `envelope'.  If you set `no envelope' in
       the defaults entry it is possible to undo that in individ­
       ual entries by using `envelope &lt;string&gt;'.   As  a  special
       case,  `envelope  "Received"' restores the default parsing
       of Received lines.

       The <B>password</B> option requires a string argument,  which  is
       the password to be used with the entry's server.

       The  `preconnect'  keyword  allows  you to specify a shell
       command to be executed just  before  each  time  <I>fetchmail</I>
       establishes  a  mailserver connection.  This may be useful
       if you are attempting to set  up  secure  POP  connections
       with  the aid of <B>ssh(1)</B>.  If the command returns a nonzero
       status, the poll of that mailserver will be aborted.

       Similarly, the `postconnect' keyword similarly allows  you
       to  specify a shell command to be executed just after each
       time a mailserver connection is taken down.

       The `forcecr' option controls whether lines terminated  by
       LF  only  are  given  CRLF  termination before forwarding.
       Strictly speaking  RFC821  requires  this,  but  few  MTAs
       enforce  the requirement it so this option is normally off
       (only one such MTA, qmail, is in significant use  at  time
       of writing).

       The `stripcr' option controls whether carriage returns are
       stripped out of retrieved mail before it is forwarded.  It
       is normally not necessary to set this, because it defaults
       to `on' (CR  stripping  enabled)  when  there  is  an  MDA
       declared but `off' (CR stripping disabled) when forwarding
       is via SMTP.  If `stripcr'  and  `forcecr'  are  both  on,
       The  `dropstatus'  option controls whether nonempty Status
       and X-Mozilla-Status lines are retained  in  fetched  mail
       (the  default)  or  discarded.  Retaining them allows your
       MUA to see what messages (if any) were marked seen on  the
       server.   On  the other hand, it can confuse some new-mail
       notifiers, which assume that anything with a  Status  line
       in  it  has  been  seen.   (Note:  the  empty Status lines
       inserted by some buggy  POP  servers  are  unconditionally
       discarded.)

       The  `dropdelivered'  option  controls wether Delivered-To
       headers will be kept in fetched mail (the default) or dis­
       carded.  These  headers  are  added  by  Qmail and Postfix
       mailservers in order to avoid mail loops but  may  get  in
       your  way  if  you try to "mirror" a mailserver within the
       same domain. Use with caution.

       The `mimedecode' option  controls  whether  MIME  messages
       using the quoted-printable encoding are automatically con­
       verted into pure 8-bit data. If you are delivering mail to
       an  ESMTP-capable, 8-bit-clean listener (that includes all
       of the major MTAs like sendmail), then this will automati­
       cally  convert  quoted-printable  message headers and data
       into 8-bit data, making it easier to understand when read­
       ing  mail.  If  your e-mail programs know how to deal with
       MIME messages,  then  this  option  is  not  needed.   The
       mimedecode option is off by default, because doing RFC2047
       conversion on headers throws away  character-set  informa­
       tion  and  can  lead to bad results if the encoding of the
       headers differs from the body encoding.

       The `idle' option is usable only with  IMAP  servers  sup­
       porting  the  RFC2177  IDLE  command  extension.  If it is
       enabled, and fetchmail detects that IDLE is supported,  an
       IDLE  will  be  issued at the end of each poll.  This will
       tell the IMAP server  to  hold  the  connection  open  and
       notify the client when new mail is available.  If you need
       to poll a link frequently,  IDLE  can  save  bandwidth  by
       eliminating TCP/IP connects and LOGIN/LOGOUT sequences. On
       the other hand, an IDLE connection will eat almost all  of
       your fetchmail's time, because it will never drop the con­
       nection and allow other pools to occur unless  the  server
       times  out  the  IDLE.  It also doesn't work with multiple
       folders; only the first folder will ever be polled.

       The `properties' option is  an  extension  mechanism.   It
       takes  a  string  argument,  which is ignored by fetchmail
       itself.  The string argument may be used to store configu­
       ration  information for scripts which require it.  In par­
       ticular, the output of  `--configdump'  option  will  make
       properties  associated with a user entry readily available
       to a Python script.

       Legal authentication types are  `any',  `password',  `ker­
       beros',  'kereberos_v5'  and  `gssapi', `cram-md5', `otp',
       `ntlm', `ssh`.  The `password' type specifies  authentica­
       tion  by  normal  transmission of a password (the password
       may be plaintext or subject to  protocol-specific  encryp­
       tion as in APOP); `kerberos' tells <I>fetchmail</I> to try to get
       a Kerberos ticket at the start of each query instead,  and
       send  an  arbitrary  string  as the password; and `gssapi'
       tells fetchmail to use  GSSAPI  authentication.   See  the
       description of the `auth' keyword for more.

       Specifying  `kpop'  sets POP3 protocol over port 1109 with
       Kerberos V4 authentication.  These defaults may  be  over­
       ridden by later options.

       There  are  currently  four global option statements; `set
       logfile' followed by a string sets the same global  speci­
       fied  by  --logfile.  A command-line --logfile option will
       override this.  Also, `set daemon' sets the poll  interval
       as  --daemon  does.   This can be overridden by a command-
       line --daemon option; in particular --daemon 0 can be used
       to force foreground operation. The `set postmaster' state­
       ment sets the address to which multidrop mail defaults  if
       there  are  no local matches.  Finally, `set syslog' sends
       log messages to <B>syslogd(8)</B>.

       sage,  fetchmail  looks  through  headers in the following
       order:

               Return-Path:
               Resent-Sender: (ignored if it doesn't contain an @ or !)
               Sender: (ignored if it doesn't contain an @ or !)
               Resent-From:
               From:
               Reply-To:
               Apparently-From:

       The originating address is used for logging,  and  to  set
       the MAIL FROM address when forwarding to SMTP.  This order
       is intended to cope gracefully with receiving mailing list
       messages  in multidrop mode. The intent is that if a local
       the  final  recipients  and  have  precedence  over  their
       To:/Cc:/Bcc:  counterparts.  If the Resent-* lines doesn't
       exist, the To:, Cc:, Bcc:  and  Apparently-To:  lines  are
       looked  for.  (The  presence  of  a Resent-To: is taken to
       imply that the person referred  by  the  To:  address  has
       already received the original copy of the mail).

<H2>CONFIGURATION EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
       Note  that  although  there are password declarations in a
       good many of the examples below, this is mainly for illus­
       trative  purposes.  We recommend stashing account/password
       pairs in your $HOME/.netrc file, where they  can  be  used
       not just by fetchmail but by <B>ftp(1)</B> and other programs.

       Basic format is:

         poll SERVERNAME protocol PROTOCOL username NAME password PASSWORD

       Example:

         poll pop.provider.net protocol pop3 username "jsmith" password "secret1"

       Or, using some abbreviations:

         poll pop.provider.net proto pop3 user "jsmith" password "secret1"

       Multiple servers may be listed:

         poll pop.provider.net proto pop3 user "jsmith" pass "secret1"
         poll other.provider.net proto pop2 user "John.Smith" pass "My^Hat"

       Here's  a  version  of  those two with more whitespace and
       some noise words:

         poll pop.provider.net proto pop3
             user "jsmith", with password secret1, is "jsmith" here;
         poll other.provider.net proto pop2:
             user "John.Smith", with password "My^Hat", is "John.Smith" here;

       This version is much easier to read and doesn't cost  sig­
       nificantly  more  (parsing  is  done only once, at startup
       time).


       If you need to include whitespace in a  parameter  string,
       enclose the string in double quotes.  Thus:

         poll mail.provider.net with proto pop3:
               user "jsmith" there has password "u can't krak this"
                           is jws here and wants mda "/bin/mail"

       (this is only likely to be useful when  running  fetchmail
       in  daemon  mode as root).  The `user' keyword leads off a
       user description, and every user specification in a multi-
       user entry must include it.  Here's an example:

         poll pop.provider.net proto pop3 port 3111
               user "jsmith" with pass "secret1" is "smith" here
               user jones with pass "secret2" is "jjones" here keep

       This  associates  the  local  username  `smith'  with  the
       pop.provider.net username `jsmith' and the local  username
       `jjones' with the pop.provider.net username `jones'.  Mail
       for `jones' is kept on the server after download.

       Here's what a simple retrieval configuration for a  multi-
       drop mailbox looks like:

         poll pop.provider.net:
               user maildrop with pass secret1 to golux 'hurkle'='happy' snark here

       This  says  that  the mailbox of account `maildrop' on the
       server is a multi-drop box, and that messages in it should
       be parsed for the server user names `golux', `hurkle', and
       `snark'.  It further specifies that  `golux'  and  `snark'
       have  the  same  name  on the client as on the server, but
       mail for server  user  `hurkle'  should  be  delivered  to
       client user `happy'.

       Here's an example of another kind of multidrop connection:

         poll pop.provider.net localdomains loonytoons.org toons.org:
               user maildrop with pass secret1 to * here

       This also says that the mailbox of account  `maildrop'  on
       the  server  is a multi-drop box.  It tells fetchmail that
       any address in the  loonytoons.org  or  toons.org  domains
       (including   subdomain  addresses  like  `joe@daffy.loony­
       toons.org') should be passed through  to  the  local  SMTP
       listener  without  modification.  Be careful of mail loops
       if you do this!

       Here's an example configuration using ssh and  the  plugin
       option.   The  queries  are made directly on the stdin and
       stdout of imapd via ssh.  Note that in  this  setup,  IMAP
       authentication can be skipped.

       poll mailhost.net with proto imap:
               plugin "ssh %h /usr/sbin/imapd" auth ssh;
                       user esr is esr here



</PRE>
<H2>THE USE AND ABUSE OF MULTIDROP MAILBOXES</H2><PRE>
       toss  several  peoples' mail in a single maildrop box, you
       may have thrown away potentially vital  information  about
       who  each  piece  of  mail  was actually addressed to (the
       `envelope address', as opposed to the header addresses  in
       the RFC822 To/Cc/Bcc headers).  This `envelope address' is
       the address you need in order to reroute mail properly.

       Sometimes <I>fetchmail</I> can deduce the envelope  address.   If
       the  mailserver  MTA  is <I>sendmail</I> and the item of mail had
       just one recipient, the MTA will have written  a  `by/for'
       clause that gives the envelope addressee into its Received
       header. But this doesn't work reliably for other MTAs, nor
       if  there  is more than one recipient.  By default, <I>fetch­</I>
       <I>mail</I> looks for envelope addresses in these lines; you  can
       restore  this  default  with  -E  "Received"  or `envelope
       Received'.

       Alternatively, some SMTP  listeners  and/or  mail  servers
       insert  a  header in each message containing a copy of the
       envelope addresses.  This header (when it exists) is often
       `X-Envelope-To'.  Fetchmail's assumption about this can be
       changed with the -E or `envelope' option.  Note that writ­
       ing  an  envelope header of this kind exposes the names of
       recipients  (including  blind-copy  recipients)   to   all
       receivers  of  the  messages;  it is therefore regarded by
       some administrators as a security/privacy problem.

       A slight variation of the `X-Envelope-To'  header  is  the
       `Delivered-To'  put  by qmail to avoid mail loops. It will
       probably prefix the user name with a string that  normally
       matches  the  user's domain. To remove this prefix you can
       use the -Q or `qvirtual' option.

       Sometimes, unfortunately, neither of these methods  works.
       When  they  all fail, fetchmail must fall back on the con­
       tents of To/Cc/Bcc headers to try to  determine  recipient
       addressees  -- and these are not reliable.  In particular,
       mailing-list software often ships mail with only the  list
       broadcast address in the To header.

       When  <I>fetchmail</I>  cannot deduce a recipient address that is
       local, and the intended recipient address was anyone other
       than  fetchmail's invoking user, mail will get lost.  This
       is what makes the multidrop feature risky.

       A related problem is that when you blind-copy a mail  mes­
       sage,  the  Bcc  information  is  carried <I>only</I> as envelope
       address (it's not put in the  headers  fetchmail  can  see
       unless  there is an X-Envelope header).  Thus, blind-copy­
       ing to someone who gets mail over a  fetchmail  link  will
       fail  unless  the  the mailserver host routinely writes X-
       Envelope or an equivalent header  into  messages  in  your
       friends'  as  a  local address gets fetched, the list name
       will be appended to the list of recipients your SMTP  lis­
       tener  sees.   Therefore  it  will undergo alias expansion
       locally.  Be sure to include  `esr'  in  the  local  alias
       expansion  of  fetchmail-friends, or you'll never see mail
       sent only to the list.  Also be sure  that  your  listener
       has  the "me-too" option set (sendmail's -oXm command-line
       option or OXm declaration) so your name isn't removed from
       alias expansions in messages you send.

       This  trick  is not without its problems, however.  You'll
       begin to  see  this  when  a  message  comes  in  that  is
       addressed  only to a mailing list you do <I>not</I> have declared
       as a local name.  Each such message will  feature  an  `X-
       Fetchmail-Warning'   header  which  is  generated  because
       fetchmail cannot find a valid local name in the  recipient
       addresses.  Such messages default (as was described above)
       to being sent to the local user running <I>fetchmail</I>, but the
       program  has no way to know that that's actually the right
       thing.


   <B>Bad</B> <B>Ways</B> <B>To</B> <B>Abuse</B> <B>Multidrop</B> <B>Mailboxes</B>
       Multidrop mailboxes and <I>fetchmail</I> serving  multiple  users
       in  daemon  mode  do not mix.  The problem, again, is mail
       from mailing lists, which typically does not have an indi­
       vidual  recipient  address  on  it.   Unless <I>fetchmail</I> can
       deduce an envelope address, such mail will only go to  the
       account  running  fetchmail (probably root).  Also, blind-
       copied users are very likely never to see  their  mail  at
       all.

       If  you're  tempted  to use <I>fetchmail</I> to retrieve mail for
       multiple users from a single mail drop via  POP  or  IMAP,
       think again (and reread the section on header and envelope
       addresses above).  It would be smarter  to  just  let  the
       mail  sit  in  the  mailserver's queue and use fetchmail's
       ETRN or ODMR modes to trigger SMTP sends periodically  (of
       course,  this  means you have to poll more frequently than
       the mailserver's expiry period).   If  you  can't  arrange
       this, try setting up a UUCP feed.

       If  you  absolutely  <I>must</I>  use multidrop for this purpose,
       make  sure  your  mailserver  writes  an  envelope-address
       header  that  fetchmail  can see.  Otherwise you <I>will</I> lose
       mail and it <I>will</I> come back to haunt you.


   <B>Speeding</B> <B>Up</B> <B>Multidrop</B> <B>Checking</B>
       Normally,  when  multiple  users  are  declared  <I>fetchmail</I>
       extracts recipient addresses as described above and checks
       each host part with DNS to see if it's  an  alias  of  the
       To  facilitate  the  use of <I>fetchmail</I> in shell scripts, an
       exit code is  returned  to  give  an  indication  of  what
       occurred during a given connection.

       The exit codes returned by <I>fetchmail</I> are as follows:

       0      One  or  more  messages were successfully retrieved
              (or, if the -c  option  was  selected,  were  found
              waiting but not retrieved).

       1      There  was  no mail awaiting retrieval.  (There may
              have been old mail still  on  the  server  but  not
              selected for retrieval.)

       2      An  error was encountered when attempting to open a
              socket to retrieve mail.  If you don't know what  a
              socket  is, don't worry about it -- just treat this
              as an 'unrecoverable error'.  This error  can  also
              be because a protocol fetchmail wants to use is not
              listed in /etc/services.

       3      The user authentication step failed.  This  usually
              means  that a bad user-id, password, or APOP id was
              specified.  Or it may mean that you  tried  to  run
              fetchmail under circumstances where it did not have
              standard input attached to a terminal and could not
              prompt for a missing password.

       4      Some sort of fatal protocol error was detected.

       5      There was a syntax error in the arguments to <I>fetch­</I>
              <I>mail</I>.

       6      The run control file had bad permissions.

       7      There  was  an  error  condition  reported  by  the
              server.  Can also fire if <I>fetchmail</I> timed out while
              waiting for the server.

       8      Client-side exclusion error.  This means  <I>fetchmail</I>
              either  found  another  copy of itself already run­
              ning, or failed in such a way that  it  isn't  sure
              whether another copy is running.

       9      The  user  authentication  step  failed because the
              server responded "lock busy".  Try  again  after  a
              brief pause!  This error is not implemented for all
              protocols, nor for all servers.  If not implemented
              for  your server, "3" will be returned instead, see
              above.  May be returned when talking to qpopper  or
              other  servers that can respond with "lock busy" or
              some similar text containing the word "lock".

       23     Internal error.  You should see a message on  stan­
              dard error with details.

       When  <I>fetchmail</I>  queries more than one host, return status
       is 0 if <I>any</I> query successfully retrieved  mail.  Otherwise
       the  returned  error  status  is  that  of  the  last host
       queried.

<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
       If  the  FETCHMAILUSER  variable is set, it is used as the
       name of the calling user (default local name) for purposes
       such as mailing error notifications.  Otherwise, if either
       the LOGNAME or USER variable is correctly  set  (e.g.  the
       corresponding  UID  matches the session user ID) then that
       name is used as the default local name.   Otherwise  <B>getp­</B>
       <B>wuid(3)</B>  must be able to retrieve a password entry for the
       session ID (this elaborate logic is designed to handle the
       case of multiple names per userid gracefully).

       If  the  environment  variable  FETCHMAILHOME  is set to a
       valid and existing directory name,  the  .fetchmailrc  and

       mail  is running will do whichever of these is appropriate
       to wake it up.



</PRE>
<H2>BUGS AND KNOWN PROBLEMS</H2><PRE>
       The mda and plugin options interact badly.   In  order  to
       collect error status from the MDA, fetchmail has to change
       its normal signal handling so that dead  plugin  processes
       don't  get  reaped  until the end of the poll cycle.  This
       can cause resource starvation if too many zombies  accumu­
       late.   So  either don't deliver to a MDA using plugins or
       risk being overrun by an army of undead.

       The RFC822 address parser used in multidrop mode chokes on
       some  @-addresses  that are technically legal but bizarre.
       Strange uses of quoting and embedded comments  are  likely
       to confuse it.

       In a message with multiple envelope headers, only the last
       one processed will be visible to fetchmail.  To get around
       this,  use  a mailserver-side filter that consolidates the
       contents of all envelope headers into a single one  (proc­
       mail,  mailagent, or maildrop can be programmed to do this
       fairly easily).

       Use of some of these protocols requires that  the  program
       send  unencrypted  passwords over the TCP/IP connection to
       the mailserver.  This creates a  risk  that  name/password
       pairs  might  be  snaffled  with  a packet sniffer or more
       sophisticated  monitoring  software.   Under   Linux   and
       FreeBSD,  the  --interface  option can be used to restrict
       polling to availability of  a  specific  interface  device
       with  a  specific local or remote IP address, but snooping
       is still possible if (a) either host has a network  device
       that  can be opened in promiscuous mode, or (b) the inter­
       vening network link can be tapped.  We recommend  the  use
       of <B>ssh(1)</B> tunnelling to not only shroud your passwords but
       encrypt the entire conversation.

       Use of the %F or %T escapes in an mda option could open  a
       security  hole,  because  they pass text manipulable by an
       attacker to a shell command.  Potential  shell  characters
       are replaced by `_' before execution.  The hole is further
       reduced by the fact that  fetchmail  temporarily  discards
       any  suid  privileges  it  may have while running the MDA.
       For maximum safety, however, don't use an mda command con­
       taining  %F  or  %T  when  fetchmail  is run from the root
       account itself.

       Fetchmail's method of sending bouncemail and spam  bounces
       The  UIDL  code  is  generally flaky and tends to lose its
       state on errors and line drops (so that old  messages  are
       re-seen).  If this happens to you, switch to IMAP4.

       The `principal' option only handles Kerberos IV, not V.
