<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>

       given  <B>command</B>  with  the  given <B>command</B> <B>options</B>, standard
       input, output and error are directed to that terminal. The
       current  search path ($PATH) is used to find the requested
       command. If no command is specified then  the  environment
       variable $SHELL is used.

   <B>OPTIONS</B>
       <I>-c</I> <I>vtnumber</I>
              Use  the  given  VT number and not the first avail­
              able. Note you must have write access to  the  sup­
              plied VT for this to work.

       <I>-s</I>     Switch to the new VT when starting the command. The
              VT of the new command will be made the new  current
              VT.

       <I>-u</I>     Figure  out  the  owner  of the current VT, and run
              login as that user.  Suitable to be called by init.
              Shouldn't be used with -c or -l.

       <I>-l</I>     Make the command a login shell. A - is prepended to
              the name of the command to be executed.

       <I>-v</I>     Be a bit more verbose.

       <I>-w</I>     wait for command to complete. If -w and -s are used
              together  then  <B>openvt</B> will switch back to the con­
              trolling terminal when the command completes.

       <I>--</I>     end of options to <B>openvt</B>.

<H2>NOTE</H2><PRE>
       If <B>openvt</B> is compiled with a POSIX (GNU) getopt() and  you
       wish  to  set  options  to the command to be run, then you
       must supply the end of options -- flag before the command.
