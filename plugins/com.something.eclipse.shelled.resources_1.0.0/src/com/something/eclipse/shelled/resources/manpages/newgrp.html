<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>newgrp</B> [<B>-</B>] [<I>group</I>]
       <B>sg</B> [<B>-</B>] [<I>group</I> [[<B>-c</B>] <I>command</I>]]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>newgrp</B>  is  used  to  change the current group ID during a
       login session.  If the  optional  <B>-</B>  flag  is  given,  the
       user's  environment  will  be  reinitialized as though the
       user had logged in,  otherwise  the  current  environment,
       including current working directory, remains unchanged.

       <B>newgrp</B>  changes  the  current  real  group ID to the named
       group, or to the default group listed in <I>/etc/passwd</I> if no
       group name is given. The user will be prompted for a pass­
       word if she do not have a password and the group does,  or
       if  the user is not listed as a member and the group has a
       password. The user will be  denied  access  if  the  group
       password  is empty and the user is not listed as a member.

       The <B>sg</B> command works similiar to <B>newgrp</B> but accepts a com­
       mand.  The command will be executed with the Bourne shell.
       With most shells you may run <B>sg</B> from, you need to  enclose
       multi-word commands in quotes.  Another difference between
       <B>newgrp</B> and <B>sg</B> is that some shells treat <B>newgrp</B>  specially,
       replacing  themselves  with a new instance of a shell that
       <B>newgrp</B> creates.  This doesn't happen with <B>sg</B>, so upon exit
       from  a <B>sg</B> command you are returned to your previous group
       ID.
