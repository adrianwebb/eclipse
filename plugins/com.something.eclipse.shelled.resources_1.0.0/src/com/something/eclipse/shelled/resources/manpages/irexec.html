<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This  program lets you execute arbitrary commands on an IR
       signal decoded by lircd, the LIRC  daemon.  You  can  give
       irexec  a command line parameter which has to be a name of
       a valid config file. If no  command  line  parameters  are
       given  irexec  reads the default config file which is usu­
       ally ~/.lircrc.

       If irexec executes a program it will wait until this  pro­
       gram terminates.  So append a '&amp;' to the command string if
       you don't want that.

       The config string consists of the command to be run.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       If you add the --daemon option irexec will fork  to  back­
       ground.  That way you can easily start irexec from an init
       script. In this case you should specify a config  file  on
       the command line as irexec won't be able to find your home
       directory. Potential uses are shutting down the  computer,
       starting a dial-up connection etc.

<H2>NOTE</H2><PRE>
       If  you  start  irexec, it reads your ~/.lircrc and reacts
       only on prog= entries that point to irexec.  If  you  have
       included more than one program in your .lircrc, then start
       all these  programs,  they  react  itself  only  to  their
       according entries in .lircrc.
