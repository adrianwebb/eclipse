       Print the value of EXPRESSION to standard output.  A blank
       line  below  separates   increasing   precedence   groups.
       EXPRESSION may be:

       ARG1 | ARG2
              ARG1 if it is neither null nor 0, otherwise ARG2

       ARG1 &amp; ARG2
              ARG1 if neither argument is null or 0, otherwise 0

       ARG1 &lt; ARG2
              ARG1 is less than ARG2

       ARG1 &lt;= ARG2
              ARG1 is less than or equal to ARG2

       ARG1 = ARG2
              ARG1 is equal to ARG2

       ARG1 != ARG2
              ARG1 is unequal to ARG2

       ARG1 &gt;= ARG2
              ARG1 is greater than or equal to ARG2

       ARG1 &gt; ARG2
              ARG1 is greater than ARG2

       ARG1 + ARG2
              arithmetic sum of ARG1 and ARG2

       ARG1 - ARG2
              arithmetic difference of ARG1 and ARG2

       ARG1 * ARG2
              arithmetic product of ARG1 and ARG2

       ARG1 / ARG2
              arithmetic quotient of ARG1 divided by ARG2

       ARG1 % ARG2
              arithmetic remainder of ARG1 divided by ARG2
              length of STRING

       + TOKEN
              interpret TOKEN as a string, even if it is a

              keyword like `match' or an operator like `/'

       ( EXPRESSION )
              value of EXPRESSION

       Beware  that  many  operators need to be escaped or quoted
       for shells.  Comparisons are arithmetic if both  ARGs  are
       numbers, else lexicographical.  Pattern matches return the
       string matched between \( and \) or null; if \( and \) are
       not  used, they return the number of characters matched or
       0.
