<H2>Note of warning</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation, and may  not  be  entirely
       accurate  or  complete.   See the end of this man page for
       details.

<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       The mcat command is used to copy an entire disk image from
       or to the floppy device. It uses the following syntax:

       mcat [-w] <I>drive</I>:

       Mcat performs the same task as the unix cat command. It is
       included into the mtools package, since cat cannot  access
       remote floppy devices offered by the mtools floppy daemon.
       Now it is possible to create boot floppies remotely.

       The default operation is reading. The output is written to
       stdout.

       If  the  -w  option  is specified, mcat reads a disk-image
       from stdin and writes it to the given  device.   <B>Use</B>  <B>this</B>
       <B>carefully!</B> Because of the lowlevel nature of this command,
       it will happily destroy any data  written  before  on  the
       disk without warning!

<H2>Viewing the texi doc</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this  process  is
       only  approximative,  and  some items, such as crossrefer­
       ences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  translation
       process.   Indeed,  these items have no appropriate repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I strongly advise you to use  the  original  texinfo  doc.
       See  the  end of this manpage for instructions how to view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo  doc,
              run the following commands:

                     <B>./configure;</B> <B>make</B> <B>dvi;</B> <B>dvips</B> <B>mtools.dvi</B>




       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.
       Indeed, in the info version certain examples are difficult
       to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
