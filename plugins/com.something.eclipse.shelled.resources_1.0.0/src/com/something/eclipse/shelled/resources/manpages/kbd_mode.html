       <B>kbd_mode</B> [ <I>-a</I> <I>|</I> <I>-u</I> <I>|</I> <I>-k</I> <I>|</I> <I>-s</I> ]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Without  argument,  <B>kbd_mode</B>  prints  the current keyboard
       mode (RAW, MEDIUMRAW or XLATE).  With  argument,  it  sets
       the keyboard mode as indicated:

       -s: scancode mode (RAW),

       -k: keycode mode (MEDIUMRAW),

       -a: ASCII mode (XLATE),

       -u: UTF-8 mode (UNICODE).

       Of  course the "-a" is only traditional, and the code used
       can be any 8-bit character set.  With "-u" a 16-bit  char­
       acter  set is expected, and these chars are transmitted to
       the kernel as 1, 2, or 3 bytes (following the  UTF-8  cod­
       ing).   In  these latter two modes the key mapping defined
       by <B>loadkeys(1)</B> is used.

       Warning: changing the keyboard mode,  other  than  between
       ASCII  and Unicode, will probably make your keyboard unus­
       able.  This command is only meant for use (say via  remote
       login)  when  some program left your keyboard in the wrong
       state.  Note that in some obsolete versions of  this  pro­
       gram the "-u" option was a synonym for "-s".
