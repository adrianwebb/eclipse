<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>indxbib</B> makes an  inverted  index  for  the  bibliographic
       databases  in  <I>filename</I>...   for  use with <B>refer(1)</B>, <B>look­</B>
       <B>bib(1)</B>, and <B>lkbib(1)</B>.  The index will be named <I>filename</I><B>.i</B>;
       the  index  is  written  to a temporary file which is then
       renamed to this.  If no filenames are given on the command
       line because the <B>-f</B> option has been used, and no <B>-o</B> option
       is given, the index will be named <B>Ind.i</B>.

       Bibliographic databases are divided into records by  blank
       lines.  Within a record, each fields starts with a <B>%</B> char­
       acter at the beginning of a line.  Fields have a one  let­
       ter name which follows the <B>%</B> character.

       The values set by the <B>-c</B>, <B>-n</B>, <B>-l</B> and <B>-t</B> options are stored
       in the index; when the index is  searched,  keys  will  be
       discarded  and  truncated in a manner appropriate to these
       options; the original keys will be used for verifying that
       any  record  found  using  the index actually contains the
       keys.  This means that a user of an index  need  not  know
       whether  these  options  were  used in the creation of the
       index, provided that not all the keys to be  searched  for
       would  have  been  discarded  during indexing and that the
       user supplies at least the part of  each  key  that  would
       have  remained after being truncated during indexing.  The
       value set by the <B>-i</B> option is also stored in the index and
       will be used in verifying records found using the index.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-v</B>     Print the version number.

       <B>-w</B>     Index whole files.  Each file is a separate record.

       <B>-c</B><I>file</I> Read the list of common words from <I>file</I> instead  of
              <B>/usr/share/groff/1.17.2/eign</B>.

       <B>-d</B><I>dir</I>  Use  <I>dir</I>  as  the  pathname  of the current working
              directory to store in the  index,  instead  of  the
              path printed by <B>pwd(1)</B>.  Usually <I>dir</I> will be a sym­
              bolic link that points to the directory printed  by
              <B>pwd(1)</B>.

       <B>-f</B><I>file</I> Read the files to be indexed from <I>file</I>.  If <I>file</I> is
              <B>-</B>, files will be read from the standard input.  The

       <B>-l</B><I>n</I>    Discard  keys that are shorter than <I>n</I>.  Initially <I>n</I>
              is 3.

       <B>-n</B><I>n</I>    Discard the <I>n</I> most common words.   Initially  <I>n</I>  is
              100.

       <B>-o</B><I>basename</I>
              The index should be named <I>basename</I><B>.i</B>.

       <B>-t</B><I>n</I>    Truncate keys to <I>n</I>.  Initially <I>n</I> is 6.

<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>
       <I>filename</I><B>.i</B>     Index.

       <B>Ind.i</B>          Default index name.

       <B>/usr/share/groff/1.17.2/eign</B>
                      List of common words.
