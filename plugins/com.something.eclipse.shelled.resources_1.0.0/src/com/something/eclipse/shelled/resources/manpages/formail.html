<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>formail</B> is a filter that can be used to  force  mail  into
       mailbox  format,  perform `From ' escaping, generate auto-
       replying headers, do simple header  munging/extracting  or
       split  up  a mailbox/digest/articles file.  The mail/mail­
       box/article contents will be expected on stdin.

       If formail is supposed to  determine  the  sender  of  the
       mail,  but  is  unable  to  find  any,  it will substitute
       `foo@bar'.

       If formail is started without any command line options, it
       will  force any mail coming from stdin into mailbox format
       and will escape <B>all</B> bogus `From ' lines with a `&gt;'.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-v</B>   Formail will print its version number and exit.

       <B>-b</B>   Don't escape any bogus mailbox  headers  (i.e.  lines
            starting with `From ').

       <B>-p</B> <I>prefix</I>
            Define  a different quotation prefix.  If unspecified
            it defaults to `&gt;'.

       <B>-Y</B>   Assume traditional Berkeley mailbox format,  ignoring
            any <B>Content-Length:</B> fields.

       <B>-c</B>   Concatenate continued fields in the header.  Might be
            convenient when  postprocessing  mail  with  standard
            (line oriented) text utilities.

       <B>-z</B>   Ensure  a  whitespace  exists  between field name and
            content.  Zap fields  which  contain  only  a  single
            whitespace   character.   Zap  leading  and  trailing
            whitespace on fields extracted with <B>-x</B>.

       <B>-f</B>   Force formail to simply pass  along  any  non-mailbox
            format  (i.e.  don't  generate  a `From ' line as the
            first line).


       <B>-k</B>   When  generating  the  auto-reply  header   or   when
            extracting fields, keep the body as well.

       <B>-t</B>   Trust  the sender to have used a valid return address
            in his header.  This causes  formail  to  select  the
            <I>header</I>  <I>sender</I> instead of the <I>envelope</I> <I>sender</I> for the
            reply.  This option should be  used  when  generating
            auto-reply  headers  from  news  articles or when the
            sender of the message is expecting a reply.

       <B>-s</B>   The input will be split up into  separate  mail  mes­
            sages,  and  piped  into  a program one by one (a new
            program is started for every part).  <B>-s</B> has to be the
            last  option  specified, the first argument following
            it is expected to be the name of a program, any other
            arguments  will  be  passed along to it.  If you omit
            the program, then formail will simply concatenate the
            splitted mails on stdout again.  See <B>FILENO</B>.

       <B>-n</B> <I>[maxprocs]</I>
            Tell  formail not to wait for every program to finish
            before starting the next (causes splits  to  be  pro­
            cessed  in  parallel).  <I>Maxprocs</I> optionally specifies
            an upper limit on the number of concurrently  running
            processes.

       <B>-e</B>   Do not require empty lines to be preceding the header
            of a new message (i.e.  the messages could  start  on
            every line).

       <B>-d</B>   Tell  formail  that  the  messages  it is supposed to
            split need not be  in  strict  mailbox  format  (i.e.
            allows  you to split digests/articles or non-standard
            mailbox formats).  This disables recognition  of  the
            <B>Content-Length:</B> field.

       <B>-B</B>   Makes  formail assume that it is splitting up a BABYL
            rmail file.

       <B>-m</B> <I>minfields</I>
            Allows you to specify the number of consecutive head­
            erfields  formail  needs to find before it decides it
            found the start of a new message, it defaults to 2.

       <B>-q</B>   Tells formail to (still detect but)  be  quiet  about
            write  errors, duplicate messages and mismatched <B>Con­</B>
            <B>tent-Length:</B> fields.  This option is on  by  default,
            to make it display the messages use <B>-q-</B>.

       <B>-D</B> <I>maxlen</I> <I>idcache</I>
            Formail  will detect if the Message-ID of the current

       <B>-a</B> <I>headerfield</I>
            Append a custom <I>headerfield</I> onto the header; but only
            if a similar field does not exist yet.  If you  spec­
            ify  either  one  of  the  field names <B>Message-ID:</B> or
            <B>Resent-Message-ID:</B> with no field contents, then  for­
            mail will generate a unique message-ID for you.

       <B>-A</B> <I>headerfield</I>
            Append  a  custom  <I>headerfield</I> onto the header in any
            case.

       <B>-i</B> <I>headerfield</I>
            Same as <B>-A</B>, except that any existing  similar  fields
            are  renamed  by  prepending  an ``Old-'' prefix.  If
            <I>headerfield</I> consists only of a  field-name,  it  will
            not be appended.

       <B>-I</B> <I>headerfield</I>
            Same  as  <B>-i</B>, except that any existing similar fields
            are simply removed.  If <I>headerfield</I> consists only  of
            a field-name, it effectively deletes the field.

       <B>-u</B> <I>headerfield</I>
            Make  the  first occurrence of this field unique, and
            thus delete all subsequent occurrences of it.

       <B>-U</B> <I>headerfield</I>
            Make the last occurrence of this  field  unique,  and
            thus delete all preceding occurrences of it.

       <B>-R</B> <I>oldfield</I> <I>newfield</I>
            Renames  all  occurrences  of  the fieldname <I>oldfield</I>
            into <I>newfield</I>.

       <B>+</B><I>skip</I>
            Skip the first <I>skip</I> messages while splitting.

       <B>-</B><I>total</I>
            Output at most <I>total</I> messages while splitting.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       When renaming, removing,  or  extracting  fields,  partial
       fieldnames  may  be  used to specify all fields that start
       with the specified value.

       By default, when generating an auto-reply header  procmail
       selects  the envelope sender from the input message.  This
       is correct  for  vacation  messages  and  other  automatic
       replies  regarding the routing or delivery of the original
       message.  If the sender is expecting a reply or the  reply
       is  being  generated  in  response  to the contents of the
       to the -r and -t options.  This usage  is  deprecated  and
       should not be used in new applications.


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
       <B>FILENO</B>
            While  splitting,  formail assigns the message number
            currently being output to this variable.  By  preset­
            ting  FILENO, you can change the initial message num­
            ber being used and the width of the zero-padded  out­
            put.   If FILENO is unset it will default to 000.  If
            FILENO is non-empty and does not  contain  a  number,
            FILENO generation is disabled.


</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
       To split up a digest one usually uses:
              formail +1 -ds &gt;&gt;the_mailbox_of_your_choice
       or
              formail +1 -ds procmail

       To remove all Received: fields from the header:
              formail -I Received:

       To  remove  all  fields except From: and Subject: from the
       header:
              formail -k -X From: -X Subject:

       To supersede the Reply-To: field in  a  header  you  could
       use:
              formail -i "Reply-To: foo@bar"

       To  convert  a  non-standard  mailbox file into a standard
       mailbox file you can use:
              formail -ds &lt;old_mailbox &gt;&gt;new_mailbox

       Or, if you have a very tolerant mailer:
              formail -a Date: -ds &lt;old_mailbox &gt;&gt;new_mailbox

       To extract the header from a message:
              formail -X ""
       or
              sed -e '/^$/ q'

       To extract the body from a message:
              formail -I ""
       or
              sed -e '1,/^$/ d'

                              causes  this  message  to  absorb a

                              lowing it in the same mailbox.

                              to pipe into didn't accept all  the

<H2>WARNINGS</H2><PRE>
       You can save yourself and others a lot of grief if you try
       to avoid using this  autoreply  feature  on  mails  coming
       through  mailinglists.  Depending on the format of the in­
       coming mail (which in turn depends on  both  the  original
       sender's  mail  agent  and  the mailinglist setup) formail
       could decide to generate an autoreply header that  replies
       to the list.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       When  formail  has  to  generate a leading `From ' line it
       normally will contain the current  date.   If  formail  is
       given the option `-a Date:', it will use the date from the
       `Date:' field in the header (if present).  However,  since
       formail  copies  it  verbatim, the format will differ from
       that expected by most mail readers.

       If formail is instructed to delete or rename  the  leading
       `From  '  line, it will not automatically regenerate it as
       usual.  To force formail to regenerate it  in  this  case,
       include <B>-a</B> <B>'From</B> <B>'</B>.

       If  formail  is  not called as the first program in a pipe
       ing excessive comments and whitespace).

       The  regular  expression that is used to find `real' post­
       marks is:
              "\n\nFrom [\t ]*[^\t\n ]+[\t ]+[^\n\t ]"

       If a <B>Content-Length:</B> field is found in a  header,  formail
       will copy the number of specified bytes in the body verba­
       tim before  resuming  the  regular  scanning  for  message
       boundaries  (except  when  splitting  digests  or Berkeley
       mailbox format is assumed).


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Calling up formail with the -h or -? options will cause it
       to display a command-line help page.
