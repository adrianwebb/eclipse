<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       <B>ldd</B> does not work on a.out shared libraries.

       <B>ldd</B> does not work with some extremely old  a.out  programs
       which  were built before <B>ldd</B> support was added to the com­
       piler releases.  If you use <B>ldd</B> on one of these  programs,
       the  program  will  attempt  to  run with argc = 0 and the
       results will be unpredictable.
