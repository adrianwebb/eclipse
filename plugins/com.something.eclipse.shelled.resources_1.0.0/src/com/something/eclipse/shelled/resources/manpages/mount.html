<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       All  files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one
       big tree, the file hierarchy, rooted at  <B>/</B>.   These  files
       can  be spread out over several devices. The <B>mount</B> command
       serves to attach the file system found on some  device  to
       the  big file tree. Conversely, the <B>umount(8)</B> command will
       detach it again.

       The standard form of the <B>mount</B> command, is
              <B>mount</B> <B>-t</B> <I>type</I> <I>device</I> <I>dir</I>
       This tells the kernel to attach the file system  found  on
       <I>device</I>  (which is of type <I>type</I>) at the directory <I>dir</I>.  The
       previous contents (if any)  and  owner  and  mode  of  <I>dir</I>
       become  invisible, and as long as this file system remains
       mounted, the pathname <I>dir</I> refers to the root of  the  file
       system on <I>device</I>.

       Three forms of invocation do not actually mount anything:
              <B>mount</B> <B>-h</B>
       prints a help message;
              <B>mount</B> <B>-V</B>
       prints a version string; and just
              <B>mount</B> <B>[-l]</B> <B>[-t</B> <I>type</I><B>]</B>
       lists all mounted file systems (of type <I>type</I>).  The option
       -l adds the (ext2, ext3 and XFS) labels in  this  listing.
       See below.

       Since  Linux  2.4.0  it is possible to remount part of the
       file hierarchy somewhere else. The call is
              <B>mount</B> <B>--bind</B> <B>olddir</B> <B>newdir</B>
       After this call the same contents  is  accessible  in  two
       places.

       This call attaches only (part of) a single filesystem, not
       possible submounts. The entire  file  hierarchy  including
       submounts is attached a second place using
              <B>mount</B> <B>--rbind</B> <B>olddir</B> <B>newdir</B>

       Since Linux 2.5.1 it is possible to atomically move a sub­
       tree to another place. The call is
              <B>mount</B> <B>--move</B> <B>olddir</B> <B>newdir</B>

       The <I>proc</I> file system is  not  associated  with  a  special
       device,  and  when mounting it, an arbitrary keyword, such
       as <I>proc</I> can be used instead  of  a  device  specification.
       (i) The command
              <B>mount</B> <B>-a</B> <B>[-t</B> <I>type</I><B>]</B> <B>[-O</B> <I>optlist</I><B>]</B>
       (usually  given  in  a bootscript) causes all file systems
       mentioned in <I>fstab</I> (of the proper type  and/or  having  or
       not having the proper options) to be mounted as indicated,
       except for those whose line contains the  <B>noauto</B>  keyword.
       Adding  the  <B>-F</B>  option  will make mount fork, so that the
       filesystems are mounted simultaneously.

       (ii) When mounting a file system mentioned  in  <I>fstab</I>,  it
       suffices to give only the device, or only the mount point.

       (iii) Normally, only the superuser can mount file systems.
       However,  when  <I>fstab</I>  contains the <B>user</B> option on a line,
       then anybody can mount the corresponding system.

       Thus, given a line
              <B>/dev/cdrom</B>  <B>/cd</B>  <B>iso9660</B>  <B>ro,user,noauto,unhide</B>
       any user can mount the iso9660 file system  found  on  his
       CDROM using the command
              <B>mount</B> <B>/dev/cdrom</B>
       or
              <B>mount</B> <B>/cd</B>
       For  more  details,  see  <B>fstab(5)</B>.   Only  the  user that
       mounted a filesystem can unmount it again.   If  any  user
       should  be able to unmount, then use <B>users</B> instead of <B>user</B>
       in the <I>fstab</I> line.  The <B>owner</B> option  is  similar  to  the
       <B>user</B>  option,  with  the restriction that the user must be
       the owner of the special file. This may be useful e.g. for
       <I>/dev/fd</I>  if a login script makes the console user owner of
       this device.

       The programs <B>mount</B> and <B>umount</B> maintain a list of currently
       mounted  file  systems in the file <I>/etc/mtab</I>.  If no argu­
       ments are given to <B>mount</B>, this list is printed.

       When the <I>proc</I> filesystem is mounted (say  at  <I>/proc</I>),  the
       files  <I>/etc/mtab</I>  and  <I>/proc/mounts</I> have very similar con­
       tents. The former has somewhat more information,  such  as
       the  mount options used, but is not necessarily up-to-date
       (cf. the <B>-n</B> option  below).  It  is  possible  to  replace
       <I>/etc/mtab</I>  by  a  symbolic  link to <I>/proc/mounts</I>, but some
       information is lost that way, and  in  particular  working
       with  the  loop  device will be less convenient, and using
       the "user" option will fail.



</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The full set of options used by an invocation of <B>mount</B>  is
       determined  by  first  extracting the options for the file
       system from the <I>fstab</I> table,  then  applying  any  options
       specified by the <B>-o</B> argument, and finally applying a <B>-r</B> or
              incarnation of mount for each device.  This will do
              the  mounts  on  different devices or different NFS
              servers in parallel.  This has the  advantage  that
              it  is  faster; also NFS timeouts go in parallel. A
              disadvantage is that the mounts are done  in  unde­
              fined  order.   Thus, you cannot use this option if
              you want to mount both <I>/usr</I> and <I>/usr/spool</I>.

       <B>-f</B>     Causes everything to be done except for the  actual
              system  call;  if  it's not obvious, this ``fakes''
              mounting the file system.  This option is useful in
              conjunction  with the <B>-v</B> flag to determine what the
              <B>mount</B> command is trying to do. It can also be  used
              to  add  entries for devices that were mounted ear­
              lier with the -n option.

       <B>-i</B>     Don't call the /sbin/mount.&lt;filesystem&gt; helper even
              if it exists.

       <B>-l</B>     Add the ext2, ext3 and XFS labels in the mount out­
              put. Mount must have permission to  read  the  disk
              device  (e.g.  be suid root) for this to work.  One
              can set such a label for ext2  or  ext3  using  the
              <B>e2label(8)</B>  utility, or for XFS using <B>xfs_admin(8)</B>.

       <B>-n</B>     Mount without writing in <I>/etc/mtab</I>.  This is neces­
              sary  for  example when <I>/etc</I> is on a read-only file
              system.

       <B>-s</B>     Tolerate sloppy mount options rather than  failing.
              This  will  ignore mount options not supported by a
              filesystem type. Not all filesystems  support  this
              option. This option exists for support of the Linux
              autofs-based automounter.

       <B>-r</B>     Mount the file system read-only. A  synonym  is  <B>-o</B>
              <B>ro</B>.

       <B>-w</B>     Mount  the  file  system  read/write.  This  is the
              default. A synonym is <B>-o</B> <B>rw</B>.

       <B>-L</B> <I>label</I>
              Mount the partition that has the specified <I>label</I>.

       <B>-U</B> <I>uuid</I>
              Mount the partition that has  the  specified  <I>uuid</I>.
              These two options require the file <I>/proc/partitions</I>
              (present since Linux 2.1.116) to exist.

       <B>-t</B> <I>vfstype</I>
              The argument following the <B>-t</B> is used  to  indicate
              the  file system type.  The file system types which
              required.  For  a  few  types  however  (like  nfs,
              smbfs,  ncpfs) ad hoc code is necessary. The nfs ad
              hoc code is built in, but smbfs and  ncpfs  have  a
              separate  mount program. In order to make it possi­
              ble to treat all types in a uniform way, mount will
              execute   the  program  <I>/sbin/mount.TYPE</I>  (if  that
              exists) when called with type <I>TYPE</I>.  Since  various
              versions  of  the  <I>smbmount</I>  program have different
              calling conventions, <I>/sbin/mount.smb</I> may have to be
              a shell script that sets up the desired call.

              The  type  <I>iso9660</I> is the default.  If no <B>-t</B> option
              is given, or if the <B>auto</B>  type  is  specified,  the
              superblock is probed for the filesystem type (<I>adfs</I>,
              <I>bfs</I>, <I>cramfs</I>, <I>ext</I>, <I>ext2</I>, <I>ext3</I>, <I>hfs</I>,  <I>hpfs</I>,  <I>iso9660</I>,
              <I>jfs</I>,  <I>minix</I>, <I>ntfs</I>, <I>qnx4</I>, <I>reiserfs</I>, <I>romfs</I>, <I>udf</I>, <I>ufs</I>,
              <I>vxfs</I>, <I>xfs</I>, <I>xiafs</I> are  supported).   If  this  probe
              fails,   mount   will   try   to   read   the  file
              <I>/etc/filesystems</I>,  or,  if  that  does  not  exist,
              <I>/proc/filesystems</I>.   All  of  the  filesystem types
              listed there will be tried, except for  those  that
              are  labeled  "nodev" (e.g., <I>devpts</I>, <I>proc</I> and <I>nfs</I>).
              If <I>/etc/filesystems</I> ends in a line with a single  *
              only, mount will read <I>/proc/filesystems</I> afterwards.

              The <B>auto</B> type may be useful for user-mounted  flop­
              pies.  Creating a file <I>/etc/filesystems</I> can be use­
              ful to change the probe order (e.g.,  to  try  vfat
              before  msdos)  or  if  you  use  a  kernel  module
              autoloader.  Warning: the probing uses a  heuristic
              (the  presence  of  appropriate `magic'), and could
              recognize the wrong filesystem type, possibly  with
              catastrophic  consequences.  If  your data is valu­
              able, don't ask <B>mount</B> to guess.

              More than one type may be specified in a comma sep­
              arated  list.  The list of file system types can be
              prefixed with <B>no</B> to specify the file  system  types
              on  which  no action should be taken.  (This can be
              meaningful with the <B>-a</B> option.)

              For example, the command:
                     <B>mount</B> <B>-a</B> <B>-t</B> <B>nomsdos,ext</B>
              mounts all file systems except those of type  <I>msdos</I>
              and <I>ext</I>.

       <B>-O</B>     Used  in  conjunction  with <B>-a</B>, to limit the set of
              filesystems to which the <B>-a</B> is applied.  Like <B>-t</B> in
              this regard except that it is useless except in the
              context of <B>-a</B>.  For example, the command:
                     <B>mount</B> <B>-a</B> <B>-O</B> <B>no_netdev</B>
              mounts all file systems except those which have the

       <B>-o</B>     Options  are specified with a <B>-o</B> flag followed by a
              comma separated string of options.  Some  of  these
              options  are  only  useful  when they appear in the
              <I>/etc/fstab</I> file.  The following  options  apply  to
              any  file  system  that  is  being mounted (but not
              every file system actually honors them - e.g.,  the
              <B>sync</B>  option  today  has effect only for ext2, ext3
              and ufs):

              <B>async</B>  All I/O to the file system  should  be  done
                     asynchronously.

              <B>atime</B>  Update  inode  access  time for each access.
                     This is the default.

              <B>auto</B>   Can be mounted with the <B>-a</B> option.

              <B>defaults</B>
                     Use default options: <B>rw</B>,  <B>suid</B>,  <B>dev</B>,  <B>exec</B>,
                     <B>auto</B>, <B>nouser</B>, and <B>async.</B>

              <B>dev</B>    Interpret character or block special devices
                     on the file system.

              <B>exec</B>   Permit execution of binaries.

              <B>_netdev</B>
                     The filesystem  resides  on  a  device  that
                     requires network access (used to prevent the
                     system  from  attempting  to   mount   these
                     filesystems   until  the  network  has  been
                     enabled on the system).

              <B>noatime</B>
                     Do not update inode  access  times  on  this
                     file  system  (e.g, for faster access on the
                     news spool to speed up news servers).

              <B>noauto</B> Can only be mounted explicitly (i.e., the <B>-a</B>
                     option  will not cause the file system to be
                     mounted).

              <B>nodev</B>  Do not interpret character or block  special
                     devices on the file system.

              <B>noexec</B> Do  not  allow  execution of any binaries on
                     the mounted file system.  This option  might
                     be useful for a server that has file systems
                     containing binaries for architectures  other
                     than its own.

              <B>nosuid</B> Do  not  allow  set-user-identifier  or set-
              <B>ro</B>     Mount the file system read-only.

              <B>rw</B>     Mount the file system read-write.

              <B>suid</B>   Allow set-user-identifier or set-group-iden­
                     tifier bits to take effect.

              <B>sync</B>   All  I/O  to  the file system should be done
                     synchronously.

              <B>dirsync</B>
                     All directory updates within the file system
                     should  be done synchronously.  This affects
                     the following  system  calls:  creat,  link,
                     unlink,  symlink,  mkdir,  rmdir,  mknod and
                     rename.

              <B>user</B>   Allow an ordinary user  to  mount  the  file
                     system.   The  name  of the mounting user is
                     written to mtab so that he can  unmount  the
                     file  system again.  This option implies the
                     options <B>noexec</B>, <B>nosuid</B>,  and  <B>nodev</B>  (unless
                     overridden  by subsequent options, as in the
                     option line <B>user,exec,dev,suid</B>).

              <B>users</B>  Allow every user to mount  and  unmount  the
                     file   system.    This  option  implies  the
                     options <B>noexec</B>, <B>nosuid</B>,  and  <B>nodev</B>  (unless
                     overridden  by subsequent options, as in the
                     option line <B>users,exec,dev,suid</B>).

       <B>--bind</B> Remount a subtree somewhere else (so that its  con­
              tents are available in both places). See above.

       <B>--move</B> Move a subtree to some other place. See above.

<H2>FILESYSTEM SPECIFIC MOUNT OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The  following options apply only to certain file systems.
       We sort them by file system. They all follow the <B>-o</B>  flag.


</PRE>
<H2>Mount options for adfs</H2><PRE>
       <B>uid=</B><I>value</I> and <B>gid=</B><I>value</I>
              Set  the  owner  and group of the files in the file
              system (default: uid=gid=0).

       <B>ownmask=</B><I>value</I> and <B>othmask=</B><I>value</I>
              Set the permission mask for  ADFS  'owner'  permis­
              sions   and   'other'   permissions,   respectively
              (default: 0700 and 0077, respectively).   See  also

       <B>reserved=</B><I>value</I>
              (Default:  2.) Number of unused blocks at the start

<H2>Mount options for devpts</H2><PRE>
       The devpts file system is a pseudo file system, tradition­
       ally mounted on <I>/dev/pts</I>.  In order to  acquire  a  pseudo
       terminal,  a  process  opens  <I>/dev/ptmx</I>; the number of the
       pseudo terminal is then made available to the process  and
       the   pseudo   terminal   slave   can   be   accessed   as
       <I>/dev/pts/</I>&lt;number&gt;.



</PRE>
<H2>Mount options for ext</H2><PRE>
       None.  Note that the `ext' file system is obsolete.  Don't
       use  it.   Since  Linux  version 2.1.21 extfs is no longer
       part of the kernel source.



</PRE>
<H2>Mount options for ext2</H2><PRE>
       The `ext2' file system is the standard Linux file  system.
       Due  to  a kernel bug, it may be mounted with random mount
       options (fixed in Linux 2.0.4).

       <B>bsddf</B> / <B>minixdf</B>
              Set the behaviour for the <I>statfs</I> system  call.  The
              <B>minixdf</B>  behaviour  is  to  return  in the <I>f</I><B>_</B><I>blocks</I>
              field the total number of blocks of the  file  sys­
              tem,  while  the  <B>bsddf</B>  behaviour  (which  is  the
              default) is to subtract the overhead blocks used by
              the  ext2  file  system  and not available for file
              storage. Thus

       % mount /k -o minixdf; df /k; umount /k
       Filesystem   1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
       /dev/sda6      2630655   86954  2412169      3%   /k

       (Note that this example shows that  one  can  add  command
       line options to the options given in <I>/etc/fstab</I>.)


       <B>check</B> / <B>check=normal</B> / <B>check=strict</B>
              Set  checking  level.  When  at  least one of these
              options is set (and <B>check=normal</B> is set by default)
              the  inodes  and  blocks  bitmaps  are checked upon
              mount (which can take half a minute or so on a  big
              disk,  and  is rather useless).  With strict check­
              ing, block deallocation checks that  the  block  to
              free is in the data zone.

       <B>check=none</B> / <B>nocheck</B>
              No  checking  is done. This is fast. Recent kernels
              do not have a check option anymore - checking  with
              <B>e2fsck(8)</B> is more meaningful.

       <B>debug</B>  Print debugging info upon each (re)mount.

       <B>errors=continue</B> / <B>errors=remount-ro</B> / <B>errors=panic</B>
              Define  the behaviour when an error is encountered.
              (Either ignore errors and just mark the file system
              erroneous  and continue, or remount the file system

       <B>resgid=</B><I>n</I> and <B>resuid=</B><I>n</I>
              The  ext2 file system reserves a certain percentage
              of  the  available  space  (by  default   5%,   see
              <B>mke2fs(8)</B> and <B>tune2fs(8)</B>).  These options determine
              who can use the reserved blocks.  (Roughly: whoever
              has  the specified uid, or belongs to the specified
              group.)

       <B>sb=</B><I>n</I>   Instead of block 1, use block <I>n</I> as superblock. This
              could  be  useful when the filesystem has been dam­
              aged.  (Earlier, copies of the superblock would  be
              made  every  8192  blocks: in block 1, 8193, 16385,
              ... (and one got  hundreds  or  even  thousands  of
              copies  on  a  big filesystem). Since version 1.08,
              <B>mke2fs</B> has  a  -s  (sparse  superblock)  option  to
              reduce  the number of backup superblocks, and since
              version 1.15 this is the default.  Note  that  this
              may  mean that ext2 filesystems created by a recent
              <B>mke2fs</B> cannot be mounted r/w  under  Linux  2.0.*.)
              The  block  number here uses 1k units. Thus, if you
              want to use logical block  32768  on  a  filesystem
              with 4k blocks, use "sb=131072".

       <B>grpquota</B> / <B>noquota</B> / <B>quota</B> / <B>usrquota</B>
              These options are accepted but ignored.


       <B>nouid32</B>
              Disables  32-bit UIDs and GIDs.  This is for inter­
              operability with older kernels which only store and
              expect 16-bit values.

<H2>Mount options for ext3</H2><PRE>
       The  `ext3' file system is version of the ext2 file system
       which has been enhanced with journalling.  It supports the
       same options as ext2 as well as the following additions:

       <B>journal=update</B>
              Update  the  ext3 file system's journal to the cur­
              rent format.

       <B>journal=inum</B>
              When a  journal  already  exists,  this  option  is
              ignored.  Otherwise, it specifies the number of the
                     to being written into the main file  system.

              <B>ordered</B>
                     This  is  the  default  mode.   All  data is
                     forced directly out to the main file  system
                     prior to its metadata being committed to the
                     journal.

              <B>writeback</B>
                     Data ordering is not preserved - data may be
                     written  into the main file system after its
                     metadata has been committed to the  journal.
                     This  is rumoured to be the highest-through­
                     put option.   It  guarantees  internal  file
                     system  integrity,  however it can allow old
                     data to appear in files after  a  crash  and
                     journal recovery.

              <B>user_xattr</B>
                     Enable  Extended  User  Attributes.  See the

              uid and gid of the current process.)

       <B>umask=</B><I>value</I>
              Set  the umask (the bitmask of the permissions that
              are <B>not</B> present). The default is the umask  of  the
              current process.  The value is given in octal.

       <B>dmask=</B><I>value</I>
              Set  the  umask  applied  to directories only.  The
              default is the umask of the current  process.   The
              value is given in octal. Present since 2.5.43.

       <B>fmask=</B><I>value</I>
              Set  the  umask applied to regular files only.  The

       <B>codepage=</B><I>value</I>
              Sets the codepage for converting to shortname char­
              acters on FAT and  VFAT  filesystems.  By  default,
              codepage 437 is used.

              The  <I>fat</I> file system can perform CRLF&lt;--&gt;NL (MS-DOS
              text format to UNIX text format) conversion in  the
              kernel.  The  following conversion modes are avail­
              able:

              <B>binary</B> no translation is performed.   This  is  the
                     default.

              <B>text</B>   CRLF&lt;--&gt;NL  translation  is performed on all
                     files.

              <B>auto</B>   CRLF&lt;--&gt;NL translation is performed  on  all
                     files  that don't have a "well-known binary"
                     extension. The list of known extensions  can
                     be  found  at the beginning of <I>fs/fat/misc.c</I>
                     (as of 2.0, the list is: exe, com, bin, app,
                     sys, drv, ovl, ovr, obj, lib, dll, pif, arc,

              Programs that do computed lseeks won't like in-ker­
              nel text conversion.  Several people have had their
              data ruined by this translation. Beware!

              For file systems mounted in binary mode, a  conver­
              sion tool (fromdos/todos) is available.

              Forces the driver to use the CVF (Compressed Volume
              File) module cvf_<I>module</I> instead of  auto-detection.
              If  the  kernel  supports  kmod, the cvf_format=xxx
              option also controls on-demand CVF module  loading.

       <B>cvf_option=</B><I>option</I>
              Option passed to the CVF module.

       <B>debug</B>  Turn  on  the  <I>debug</I>  flag.  A version string and a

              uid and gid of the current process.)

       <B>umask=</B><I>value</I>
              Set  the umask (the bitmask of the permissions that
              are <B>not</B> present). The default is the umask  of  the
              current process.  The value is given in octal.

       <B>case=lower</B> / <B>case=asis</B>
              Convert  all  files  names  to lower case, or leave

       <B>conv=binary</B> / <B>conv=text</B> / <B>conv=auto</B>
              For <B>conv=text</B>, delete some random CRs (in  particu­

</PRE>
<H2>Mount options for iso9660</H2><PRE>
       ISO  9660  is a standard describing a filesystem structure
       to be used on CD-ROMs. (This filesystem type is also  seen
       on some DVDs. See also the <I>udf</I> filesystem.)

       Normal  <I>iso9660</I>  filenames  appear  in a 8.3 format (i.e.,
       DOS-like restrictions on filename length), and in addition
       all  characters are in upper case.  Also there is no field
       for file ownership, protection, number of links, provision
       for block/character devices, etc.

       Rock Ridge is an extension to iso9660 that provides all of
       these unix like features.  Basically there are  extensions
       to each directory record that supply all of the additional
       information, and when Rock Ridge is in use, the filesystem
       is  indistinguishable  from  a  normal  UNIX  file  system

       <B>uid=</B><I>value</I> and <B>gid=</B><I>value</I>
              Give  all  files  in  the file system the indicated
              user or group id, possibly overriding the  informa­
              tion found in the Rock Ridge extensions.  (Default:
              <B>uid=0,gid=0</B>.)

       <B>map=n[ormal]</B> / <B>map=o[ff]</B> / <B>map=a[corn]</B>
              For non-Rock Ridge volumes, normal name translation
              maps  upper  to  lower case ASCII, drops a trailing
              `;1', and converts `;' to  `.'.   With  <B>map=off</B>  no
              name  translation  is  done. See <B>norock</B>.  (Default:
              <B>map=normal</B>.)  <B>map=acorn</B> is like <B>map=normal</B> but also
              apply Acorn extensions if present.

       <B>mode=</B><I>value</I>
              For  non-Rock  Ridge  volumes,  give  all files the
              indicated  mode.   (Default:  read  permission  for
              everybody.)  Since Linux 2.1.37 one no longer needs
              to specify the mode in decimal. (Octal is indicated
              by a leading 0.)

       <B>unhide</B> Also show hidden and associated files.

       <B>block=[512|1024|2048]</B>
              Set   the   block  size  to  the  indicated  value.
              (Default: <B>block=1024</B>.)

       <B>conv=a[uto]</B> / <B>conv=b[inary]</B> / <B>conv=m[text]</B> / <B>conv=t[ext]</B>
              (Default: <B>conv=binary</B>.)  Since  Linux  1.3.54  this
              option has no effect anymore.  (And non-binary set­

       <B>cruft</B>  If  the high byte of the file length contains other
              garbage, set this mount option to ignore  the  high
              order bits of the file length.  This implies that a
              file cannot  be  larger  than  16MB.   The  `cruft'
              option is set automatically if the entire CDROM has
              a weird size (negative, or more than 800MB). It  is
              also  set when volume sequence numbers other than 0
              or 1 are seen.

       <B>session=</B><I>x</I>
              Select number of session on multisession CD. (Since

              Session begins from sector xxx. (Since 2.3.4.)

       <B>iocharset=name</B>
              Character set to use for converting from Unicode to
              ASCII.  Joliet filenames are stored in Unicode for­
              mat, but Unix for the most part doesn't know how to
              deal with Unicode.  There  is  also  an  option  of
              doing UTF8 translations with the utf8 option.

       <B>utf8</B>   Encode Unicode names in UTF8 format. Default is no.

<H2>Mount options for ncp</H2><PRE>
       Just  like  <I>nfs</I>,  the  <I>ncp</I> implementation expects a binary

       call.  This argument is constructed by <B>ncpmount(8)</B> and the

<H2>Mount options for nfs</H2><PRE>
       Instead  of a textual option string, parsed by the kernel,
       the <I>nfs</I> file system expects  a  binary  argument  of  type
       <I>struct</I>  <I>nfs</I><B>_</B><I>mount</I><B>_</B><I>data</I>.   The  program <B>mount</B> itself parses
       the following options of the form  `tag=value',  and  puts
       them   in   the  structure  mentioned:  <B>rsize=</B><I>n,</I>  <B>wsize=</B><I>n,</I>

       <B>nfsvers=</B><I>n,</I>  <B>namlen=</B><I>n.</I>   The  option <B>addr=</B><I>n</I> is accepted but
       ignored.  Also the  following  Boolean  options,  possibly
       preceded  by  <B>no</B> are recognized: <B>bg</B>, <B>fg</B>, <B>soft</B>, <B>hard</B>, <B>intr</B>,

       Especially useful options include

       <B>rsize=8192,wsize=8192</B>
              This will make your nfs connection faster than with
              the default buffer size of 4096.  (NFSv2  does  not
              work with larger values of <B>rsize</B> and <B>wsize</B>.)

       <B>uni_xlate=[0|1|2]</B>
              For 0 (or `no'  or  `false'),  do  not  use  escape
              sequences  for  unknown  Unicode characters.  For 1
              (or `yes' or `true') or 2,  use  vfat-style  4-byte
              escape  sequences  starting with ":". Here 2 give a
              little-endian encoding and 1 a  byteswapped  bigen­

       <B>posix=[0|1]</B>
              If enabled (posix=1), the file system distinguishes
              between upper and lower case. The 8.3  alias  names

<H2>Mount options for reiserfs</H2><PRE>
       Reiserfs is a journaling filesystem.  The  reiserfs  mount

       <I>http://www.namesys.com/mount-options.html</I>.

       <B>conv</B>   Instructs version 3.6 reiserfs software to mount  a

              <B>tea</B>    A Davis-Meyer function implemented by Jeremy
                     Fitzhardinge.  It uses hash  permuting  bits
                     in  the  name.  It gets high randomness and,
                     therefore, low probability  of  hash  colli­
                     sions at come CPU cost.  This may be used if
                     EHASHCOLLISION errors are  experienced  with
                     the r5 hash.

              <B>r5</B>     A  modified  version of the rupasov hash. It
                     is used by default and is  the  best  choice
                     unless  the file system has huge directories
                     and unusual file-name patterns.

              <B>detect</B> Instructs <I>mount</I> to detect which  hash  func­
                     tion  is in use by examining the file system
                     being mounted,  and to write  this  informa­
                     tion  into  the reiserfs superblock. This is
                     only useful on the first  mount  of  an  old
                     format file system.

       <B>hashed_relocation</B>
              Tunes the block allocator. This may provide perfor­

              Tunes the block allocator. This may provide perfor­
              mance improvements in some situations.

       <B>noborder</B>
              Disable  the border allocator algorithm invented by
              Yury Yu. Rupasov.   This  may  provide  performance
              improvements in some situations.

       <B>nolog</B>  Disable  journalling. This will provide slight per­
              formance improvements in  some  situations  at  the
              cost   of  losing  reiserfs's  fast  recovery  from
              crashes.  Even with this option turned on, reiserfs
              still performs all journalling operations, save for
              actual writes into its journalling area.  Implemen­
              tation of <I>nolog</I> is a work in progress.

       <B>notail</B> By  default,  reiserfs stores small files and `file
              tails' directly into its tree. This  confuses  some
              utilities  such as <B>LILO(8)</B><B>.</B>  This option is used to

              UFS is a file system widely used in different oper­
              ating  systems.   The problem are differences among
              implementations. Features of  some  implementations
              are undocumented, so its hard to recognize the type
              of ufs automatically.  That's  why  the  user  must
              specify  the type of ufs by mount option.  Possible
              values are:

              <B>old</B>    Old format of ufs, this is the default, read
                     only.  (Don't forget to give the -r option.)

              <B>44bsd</B>  For filesystems created by a BSD-like system
                     (NetBSD,FreeBSD,OpenBSD).

              <B>sun</B>    For  filesystems created by SunOS or Solaris
                     on Sparc.

              <B>sunx86</B> For filesystems created by Solaris on x86.

              <B>nextstep</B>
                     For filesystems created by NeXTStep (on NeXT

       <B>uni_xlate</B>
              Translate unhandled Unicode characters  to  special
              escaped   sequences.   This  lets  you  backup  and
              restore filenames that are created with any Unicode
              characters. Without this option, a '?' is used when
              no translation is possible. The escape character is
              ':'  because  it  is  otherwise illegal on the vfat
              filesystem. The escape  sequence  that  gets  used,
              where  u  is  the  unicode character, is: ':', (u &amp;
              0x3f), ((u&gt;&gt;6) &amp; 0x3f), (u&gt;&gt;12).

              number, before trying <I>name~num.ext</I>.

       <B>utf8</B>   UTF8 is the filesystem safe 8-bit encoding of  Uni­
              code  that  is  used  by  the console. It can be be
              enabled for the filesystem with  this  option.   If
              `uni_xlate' gets set, UTF8 gets disabled.

       <B>shortname=[lower|win95|winnt|mixed]</B>

              Defines  the  behaviour for creation and display of
              filenames which fit into 8.3 characters. If a  long
              name for a file exists, it will always be preferred
              display. There are four modes:

              <I>lower</I>  Force the short name to lower case upon dis­
                     play;  store a long name when the short name
                     is not all upper case.

              Sets the preferred buffered I/O size (default  size
              is  64K).   <I>size</I> must be expressed as the logarithm
              (base2) of the desired I/O size.  Valid values  for
              this option are 14 through 16, inclusive (i.e. 16K,
              32K, and 64K bytes).  On machines with a  4K  page­
              size, 13 (8K bytes) is also a valid <I>size</I>.  The pre­
              ferred buffered I/O size can also be altered on  an
              individual  file  basis  using  the <B>ioctl(2)</B> system

       <B>logbufs=</B><I>value</I>
              Set  the  number  of  in-memory log buffers.  Valid
              numbers range  from  2-8  inclusive.   The  default
              value is 8 buffers for filesystems with a blocksize
              of 64K, 4 buffers for filesystems with a  blocksize
              of  32K, 3 buffers for filesystems with a blocksize
              of 16K, and 2 buffers for all other configurations.
              Increasing  the number of buffers may increase per­
              formance on some workloads at the cost of the  mem­
              ory  used  for the additional log buffers and their
              associated control structures.

       <B>logbsize=</B><I>value</I>
              Set the size of each in-memory log  buffer.   Valid
              sizes are 16384 (16K) and 32768 (32K).  The default
              value for machines with more than 32MB of memory is
              32768,  machines  with  less  memory  use  16384 by

              time  device.   An  XFS  filesystem has up to three
              parts: a data section, a log section, and  a  real-
              time  section.   The real-time section is optional,
              and the log section can be separate from  the  data
              section or contained within it.  Refer to <B>xfs(5)</B>.

       <B>noalign</B>
              Data allocations will not be aligned at stripe unit
              boundaries.

       <B>noatime</B>
              Access timestamps are not updated when  a  file  is
              read.

              option  is in effect, timestamp updates from O_SYNC
              writes can be lost if the system crashes.

       <B>quota</B> / <B>usrquota</B> / <B>uqnoenforce</B>
              User disk  quota  accounting  enabled,  and  limits
              (optionally) enforced.

       <B>grpquota</B> / <B>gqnoenforce</B>
              Group  disk  quota  accounting  enabled  and limits
              (optionally) enforced.

       <B>sunit=</B><I>value</I> and <B>swidth=</B><I>value</I>
              Used to specify the stripe unit  and  width  for  a
              RAID  device  or  a  stripe  volume.  <I>value</I> must be
              specified in 512-byte block units.  If this  option
              is  not  specified and the filesystem was made on a
              stripe volume or the  stripe  width  or  unit  were
              specified  for  the  RAID device at mkfs time, then
              the mount system call will restore the  value  from
              the  superblock.   For  filesystems  that  are made
              directly on RAID devices, these options can be used
              to  override  the  information in the superblock if
              the  underlying  disk  layout  changes  after   the
              filesystem  has been created.  The <B>swidth</B> option is
              required if the <B>sunit</B> option  has  been  specified,
              and must be a multiple of the <B>sunit</B> value.

<H2>Mount options for xiafs</H2><PRE>
       None. Although nothing is wrong with xiafs, it is not used
       much, and is not maintained. Probably  one  shouldn't  use
       it.  Since Linux version 2.1.21 xiafs is no longer part of
       the kernel source.



</PRE>
<H2>THE LOOP DEVICE</H2><PRE>
       One further possible type is a mount via the loop  device.
       For example, the command

         <B>mount</B> <B>/tmp/fdimage</B> <B>/mnt</B> <B>-t</B> <B>msdos</B> <B>-o</B> <B>loop=/dev/loop3,blocksize=1024</B>

       will  set  up  the loop device <I>/dev/loop3</I> to correspond to
       the file <I>/tmp/fdimage</I>, and then mount this device on <I>/mnt</I>.
       This type of mount knows about three options, namely <B>loop</B>,
       <B>offset</B> and <B>encryption</B>, that are  really  options  to  <B>los­</B>
       <B>etup(8)</B>.   If  no  explicit  loop device is mentioned (but
       just an option `<B>-o</B> <B>loop</B>' is given), then <B>mount</B> will try to
       find some unused loop device and use that.  If you are not
       so  unwise  as  to  make  <I>/etc/mtab</I>  a  symbolic  link  to
       <I>/proc/mounts</I>  then any loop device allocated by <B>mount</B> will
       be freed by <B>umount</B>.  You can also free a  loop  device  by
       hand, using `losetup -d', see <B>losetup(8)</B>.

       <B>8</B>      user interrupt

       <B>16</B>     problems writing or locking /etc/mtab

       <B>32</B>     mount failure

       <B>64</B>     some mount succeeded

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       It  is  possible  for  a  corrupted file system to cause a
       crash.

       Some Linux file systems  don't  support  <B>-o</B>  <B>sync</B>  <B>and</B>  <B>-o</B>
       <B>dirsync</B>  (the  ext2  and ext3 file systems <I>do</I> support syn­
       chronous updates (a la BSD) when  mounted  with  the  <B>sync</B>
       option).

       The  <B>-o</B> <B>remount</B> may not be able to change mount parameters
       (all <I>ext2fs</I>-specific parameters, except <B>sb</B>, are changeable
       with  a  remount, for example, but you can't change <B>gid</B> or
       <B>umask</B> for the <I>fatfs</I>).

<H2>HISTORY</H2><PRE>
       A <B>mount</B> command existed in Version 5 AT&amp;T UNIX.
