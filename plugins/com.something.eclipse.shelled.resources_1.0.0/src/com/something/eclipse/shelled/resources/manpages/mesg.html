       <B>mesg</B> <B>[</B> <B>n</B> <B>]</B> <B>[</B> <B>y</B> <B>]</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  <B>mesg</B>  utility  is invoked by a users to control write
       access others have to the terminal device associated  with
       the  standard  error  output.  If write access is allowed,
       then programs such as <B>talk(1)</B>  and  <B>write(1)</B>  may  display
       messages on the terminal.

       Traditionally,  write  access is allowed by default.  How­
       ever, as users become more conscious of  various  security
       risks, there is a trend to remove write access by default,
       at least for the primary login shell.  To make  sure  your
       ttys  are set the way you want them to be set, <B>mesg</B> should
       be executed in your login scripts.

       Options available:

       <B>n</B>      Disallows messages.

       <B>y</B>      Permits messages to be displayed.

       If no arguments are given, <B>mesg</B> displays the present  mes­
       sage status to the standard error output.

       The <B>mesg</B> utility exits with one of the following values:

        <I>0</I>     Messages are allowed.

        <I>1</I>     Messages are not allowed.

       <I>&gt;1</I>     An error has occurred.
