<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>lsdev</B>



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>lsdev</B>  gathers information about your computer's installed
       hardware from the <B>interrupts,</B> <B>ioports</B> and <B>dma</B> files in the
       <B>/proc</B> directory, thus giving you a quick overview of which
       hardware uses what I/O addresses  and  what  IRQ  and  DMA
       channels.



</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       None.



</PRE>
<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>
       <B>/proc/interrupts</B>
              IRQ channels.


       <B>/proc/ioports</B>
              I/O memory addresses.


       <B>/proc/dma</B>
              DMA channels.



</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       <B>lsdev</B>  can't  always  figure  out which lines in the three
       examined files refer to one and the same  device,  because
       these  files  sometimes  use  different names for the same
       piece of hardware. For example, in some kernels  the  key­
       board  is  referred  to  as  `kbd' in <B>/proc/ioports</B> and as
       `keyboard' in <B>/proc/interrupts.</B>  This should be  fixed  in
       the  kernel, not in <B>lsdev</B> (as has indeed happened for this
       particular example).

       The program does however try to match lines  by  stripping
       anything  after a space or open parenthesis from the name,
       so that e.g.  the  `serial'  lines  from  <B>/proc/interrupts</B>
       match  the  `serial(set)'  lines from <B>/proc/ioports.</B>  This
       attempt at DWIM might be considered a bug in itself.

       This program only shows the kernel's <B>idea</B> of what hardware
       is present, not what's actually physically available.
