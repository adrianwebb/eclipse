<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This  linker understands only the object files produced by
       the as86 assembler, it can link them into either an impure
       or a separate I&amp;D executable.

       The linking defaults are everything off or none except for
       <B>-0</B> and the output file is <B>a.out</B>.  There is <I>not</I> a  standard
       library location defined in the linker.



</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-0</B>     produce header with 16-bit magic

       <B>-3</B>     produce header with 32-bit magic

       <B>-d</B>     delete  the  header  from the output file, used for
              MSDOS  COM  files.  As  a  side  effect  this  also
              includes  -s  as  there's  nowhere  to put a symbol
              table.

       <B>-Cx</B>    add file libdir-from-search/crtx.o to list of files
              linked

       <B>-D</B>     data  base  address follows (in format suitable for
              strtoul)

       <B>-H</B>     the top of heap (initial stack) address (in  format
              suitable for strtoul)

       <B>-Lx</B>    add  dir  name x to the head of the list of library
              dirs searched

       <B>-M</B>     print symbols linked on stdout

       <B>-N</B>     Create a native Linux OMAGIC output  file.  If  the
              contents  are  i386  code  the binary can be either
              linked by GCC or  executed  by  linux.  If  the  <B>-z</B>
              option  is  also included the linker can generate a
              QMAGIC executable.

       <B>-Ox</B>    add library libdir-from-search/x to list  of  files
              linked

       <B>-T</B>     text  base  address follows (in format suitable for
              strtoul)

              if possible.

       <B>-t</B>     trace modules being looked at on stdout

       <B>-y</B>     Alter the symbol tables to add  label  'extensions'
              so  that  labels with more than 8 characters can be
              stored in elks executables.

       <B>-z</B>     produce   "unmapped   zero   page"   or    "QMAGIC"
              executables

       All  the  options not taking an argument may be turned off
       by following the option letter by a '-', as for cc1.


</PRE>
<H2>PREDEFINED LABELS</H2><PRE>
       The linker predefines several labels that can be  imported
       into user programs.

       <B>__etext</B>
              Standard  C  variable  for  the  end  of  the  text
              segment.

       <B>__edata</B>
              Standard C variable for the end of  the  initilised
              data.

       <B>__end</B>  Standard C variable for the end of the bss area.

       <B>__segoff</B>
              The  offset  within the executable file between the
              start of the text segment and the start of the data
              segment  in 16 byte 'paragraphs'. Note this is <B>zero</B>
              for impure (tiny model) executables and is adjusted
              for executables that don't start at offset 0 within
              the segment.

       <B>__segXDL</B>
              The lowest address with data in  segment  'X'.  (eg
              __seg0DL  is  for segment zero or the text segment,
              __seg3DL is for the data segment) The value 'X'  is
              a hex digit.

       <B>__segXDH</B>
              The top of segment 'X's data area.

       <B>__segXCL</B>
              The   bottom  of  segment  'X's  'common  data'  or
              unitilised data area.  Each  segment  has  both  an
              initilised and unitilised data area.

       <B>__segXCH</B>
              The top of segment 'X's common area.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       The linker cannot deal with reverse seeks  caused  by  <B>org</B>
       instructions  in the object file. Unlike previous versions
       the current one traps the error rather than trying to fill
       up the hard disk.

       The  linker  produces  a broken a.out object file if given
       one input and the <B>-r</B> option this is so  it  is  compatible
       with pre-dev86 versions.
