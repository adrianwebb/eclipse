<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>ipcrm</I>  removes  System  V interprocess communication (IPC)
       objects and associated data structures  from  the  system.
       In order to delete such objects, you must be superuser, or
       the creator or owner of the object.

       System V IPC objects are of three  types:  shared  memory,
       message  queues,  and  semaphores.   Deletion of a message
       queue or semaphore  object  is  immediate  (regardless  of
       whether  any process still holds an IPC identifier for the
       object).  A shared memory object is only removed after all
       currently  attached processes have detached (<B>shmdt(2)</B>) the
       object from their virtual address space.

       Two syntax styles are supported.  The old Linux historical
       syntax  specifies  a three letter keyword indicating which
       class of object is to be deleted, followed by one or  more
       IPC identifiers for objects of this type.

       The  SUS-compliant syntax allows the specification of zero
       or more objects of all three types  in  a  single  command
       line,  with  objects specified either by key or by identi­
       fier. (See below.)  Both keys and identifiers may be spec­
       ified  in  decimal, hexadecimal (specified with an initial
       '0x' or '0X'), or octal (specified with an initial '0').

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-M</B> <I>shmkey</I>
              removes the  shared  memory  segment  created  with
              <I>shmkey</I> after the last detach is performed.

       <B>-m</B> <I>shmid</I>
              removes  the  shared  memory  segment identified by
              <I>shmid</I> after the last detach is performed.

       <B>-Q</B> <I>msgkey</I>
              removes the message queue created with <I>msgkey</I>.

       <B>-q</B> <I>msgid</I>
              removes the message queue identified by <I>msgid</I>.

       <B>-S</B> <I>semkey</I>
       just identifier), and to  respect  the  same  command-line
       syntax.  For backward compatibility the previous syntax is
       still supported.
