<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This program will record the signals from your remote con­
       trol  and  create a config file for lircd. A proper config
       file for lircd is maybe the most vital part of this  pack­
       age,  so  you  should invest some time to create a working
       config file. Although I put a good deal of effort in  this
       program  it  is often not possible to automatically recog­
       nize all features of a remote control.

       If the program fails to  recognize  the  protocol  of  the
       remote  control  you  should  use the --force option to at
       least create a config file in raw mode.

       If  <I>file</I>  already  exists  and  contains  a  valid  config
       irrecord will use the protocol description found there and
       will only try to record the buttons. This is  very  useful
       if  you  want  to learn a remote where config files of the
       same brand are already available. Of course this will only
       work if the remotes use the same protocol but it's worth a
       try. You will find template files for the most common pro­
       tocols  in the remotes/generic/ directory of this package.
       The name of the new file is created by appending .conf  to
       the given filename in this case.
