<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>Eject</B>  allows  removable media (typically a CD-ROM, floppy
       disk, tape, or JAZ or ZIP disk) to be ejected under  soft­
       ware control. The command can also control some multi-disc
       CD-ROM changers, the auto-eject feature supported by  some
       devices, and close the disc tray of some CD-ROM drives.

       The  device  corresponding  to &lt;name&gt; is ejected. The name
       can be a device file or mount point, either a full path or
       with  the  leading "/dev" or "/mnt" omitted. If no name is
       specified, the default name "cdrom" is used.

       There are four different methods of ejecting, depending on
       whether  the  device  is  a CD-ROM, SCSI device, removable
       floppy, or tape. By default eject tries all  four  methods
       in order until it succeeds.

       If the device is currently mounted, it is unmounted before
       ejecting.




</PRE>
<H2>COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-h</B>   This option causes <B>eject</B> to display a brief  descrip­
            tion of the command options.


       <B>-v</B>   This  makes  <B>eject</B> run in verbose mode; more informa­
            tion is displayed about what the command is doing.


       <B>-d</B>   If invoked with this option, <B>eject</B> lists the  default
            device name.


       <B>-a</B> <B>on|1|off|0</B>
            This  option  controls the auto-eject mode, supported
            by some devices.  When enabled, the  drive  automati­
            cally ejects when the device is closed.


       <B>-x</B> <B>&lt;speed&gt;</B>
            With  this  option the drive is given a CD-ROM select
            speed command.  The speed argument is a number  indi­
            cating  the desired speed (e.g. 8 for 8X speed), or 0
            for maximum data rate. Not all devices  support  this
            command  and  you  can  only  specify speeds that the
            drive is capable of. Every time the media is  changed
            this  option  is  cleared.  This  option  can be used
            alone, or with the -t and -c options.


       <B>-n</B>   With this option the selected device is displayed but
            no action is performed.


       <B>-r</B>   This  option  specifies  that  the  drive  should  be
            ejected using a CDROM eject command.


       <B>-s</B>   This  option  specifies  that  the  drive  should  be
            ejected using SCSI commands.


       <B>-f</B>   This  option  specifies  that  the  drive  should  be
            ejected using a removable floppy disk eject  command.


       <B>-q</B>   This  option  specifies  that  the  drive  should  be
            ejected using a tape drive offline command.


       <B>-p</B>   This option allow you  to  use  /proc/mounts  instead
            /etc/mtab. It also passes the -n option to <B>umount(1)</B>.


       <B>-V</B>   This option causes <B>eject</B> to display the program  ver­
            sion and exit.



</PRE>
<H2>LONG OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       All  options  have  corresponding  long  names,  as listed
       below. The long names can be abbreviated as long  as  they
       are unique.

       -h --help
       -v --verbose
       -d --default
       -a --auto
       -c --changerslot
       -t --trayclose
       -x --cdspeed
       -n --noop

              eject cdrom

       Eject using device name:

              eject /dev/cdrom

       Eject using mount point:

              eject /mnt/cdrom/

       Eject 4th IDE device:

              eject hdd

       Eject first SCSI device:

              eject sda

       Eject using SCSI partition name (e.g. a ZIP drive):

              eject sda4

       Select 5th disc on mult-disc changer:

              eject -v -c5 /dev/cdrom

       Turn on auto-eject on a SoundBlaster CD-ROM drive:

              eject -a on /dev/sbpcd



</PRE>
<H2>EXIT STATUS</H2><PRE>
       Returns  0  if  operation  was  successful, 1 if operation
       failed or command syntax was not valid.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       <B>Eject</B> only works with devices that support one or more  of
       the  four  methods  of ejecting. This includes most CD-ROM
       drives  (IDE,  SCSI,  and  proprietary),  some  SCSI  tape
       drives,  JAZ  drives, ZIP drives (parallel port, SCSI, and
       IDE versions), and LS120 removable  floppies.  Users  have
       also  reported success with floppy drives on Sun SPARC and
       Apple Macintosh systems. If <B>eject</B> does  not  work,  it  is
       most  likely  a  limitation  of  the kernel driver for the
       device and not the <B>eject</B> program itself.

       The -r, -s, -f, and -q  options  allow  controlling  which
       methods  are  used  to  eject. More than one method can be
       specified. If none of  these  options  are  specified,  it
       tries all four (this works fine in most cases).

       If  the auto-eject feature is enabled, then the drive will
       always be ejected after  running  this  command.  Not  all
       Linux  kernel  CD-ROM drivers support the auto-eject mode.
       There is no way to find out the state  of  the  auto-eject
       mode.

       You  need  appropriate  privileges  to  access  the device
       files. Running as root or setuid root is required to eject
       some devices (e.g. SCSI devices).

       The  heuristic  used to find a device, given a name, is as
       follows. If the name ends  in  a  trailing  slash,  it  is
       removed  (this  is  to  support  filenames generated using
       shell file name completion). If the name starts  with  '.'
       or  '/',  it  tries  to  open it as a device file or mount
       point.  If  that  fails,  it  tries  prepending   '/dev/',
       '/mnt/',  '/dev/cdroms',  '/dev/rdsk/',  '/dev/dsk/',  and
       finally './' to the name, until a  device  file  or  mount
       point  is  found  that  can  be opened. The program checks
       /etc/mtab for mounted devices.  If  that  fails,  it  also
       checks  /etc/fstab for mount points of currently unmounted
       devices.

       Creating symbolic links such as /dev/cdrom or /dev/zip  is
       recommended  so  that  <B>eject</B> can determine the appropriate
       devices using easily remembered names.

       To save typing you can create a shell alias for the  eject
       options that work for your particular setup.
