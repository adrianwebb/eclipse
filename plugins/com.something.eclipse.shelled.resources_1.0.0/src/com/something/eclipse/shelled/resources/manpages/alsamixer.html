<H2>KEYBOARD COMMANDS</H2><PRE>
       <B>alsamixer</B>  recognizes  the  following keyboard commands to
       control the soundcard.


   <B>General</B> <B>Controls</B>
       The <I>Left</I> and <I>right</I> <I>arrow</I> keys are used to select the chan­
       nel  (or device, depending on your preferred terminology).
       You can also use <I>n</I> ("next") and <I>p</I> ("previous").

       The <I>Up</I> and <I>Down</I> <I>Arrows</I> control the  volume  for  the  cur­
       rently  selected  device.  You can also use <I>+</I> or <I>-</I> for the
       same  purpose.  Both  the  left  and  right  signals   are
       affected.  For  independent  left  and  right control, see
       below.
       <I>L</I> re-draws the screen.


   <B>Quick</B> <B>Volume</B> <B>Changes</B>
       <I>PageUp</I> increases volume by 5.

       <I>PageDown</I> decreases volume by 5.

       <I>End</I> sets volume to 0.

       You  can  also control left &amp; right levels for the current
       channel independently, as follows:

       [<I>Q</I> | <I>W</I> | <I>E</I> ]  -- turn UP [ left | both | right ]

       [<I>Z</I> | <I>X</I> | <I>C</I> ] -- turn DOWN [ left | both | right ]

       If the currently selected mixer channel is  not  a  stereo
       channel,  then  all UP keys will work like <I>W</I>, and all DOWN
       keys will work like <I>X</I>.


   <B>Exiting</B>
       Quit the program with <I>ALT</I> <I>Q</I>, or by  hitting  <I>ESC</I>.   Please
       note  that  you might need to hit <I>ESC</I> twice on some termi­
       nals since it's regarded as a prefix key.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       Some terminal emulators (e.g. <B>nxterm</B>) may not  work  quite
       right with ncurses, but that's their own damn fault. Plain
       old <B>xterm</B> seems to be fine.
