       <B>getfacl</B> [-dRLPvh] file ...

       <B>getfacl</B> [-dRLPvh] -



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       For  each file, getfacl displays the file name, owner, the
       group, and the Access Control List (ACL). If  a  directory
       has  a default ACL, getfacl also displays the default ACL.
       Non-directories cannot have default ACLs.

       If getfacl is used on a file system that does not  support
       ACLs,  getfacl  displays the access permissions defined by
       the traditional file mode permission bits.

       The output format of getfacl is as follows:
               1:  # file: somedir/
               2:  # owner: lisa
               3:  # group: staff
               4:  user::rwx
               5:  user:joe:rwx               #effective:r-x
               6:  group::rwx                 #effective:r-x
               7:  group:cool:r-x
               8:  mask:r-x
               9:  other:r-x
              10:  default:user::rwx
              11:  default:user:joe:rwx       #effective:r-x
              12:  default:group::r-x
              13:  default:mask:r-x
              14:  default:other:---


       Lines 4, 6 and 9 correspond to the user, group  and  other
       fields  of  the file mode permission bits. These three are
       called the base ACL entries. Lines 5 and 7 are named  user
       and  named  group  entries. Line 8 is the effective rights
       mask. This entry limits the effective  rights  granted  to
       all  groups and to named users. (The file owner and others
       permissions are not affected by the effective rights mask;
       all  other entries are.)  Lines 10--14 display the default
       ACL associated with this directory. Directories may have a
       default ACL. Regular files never have a default ACL.

       The  default  behavior  for getfacl is to display both the
       ACL and the default  ACL,  and  to  include  an  effective
       rights  comment  for  lines  where the rights of the entry
       differ from the effective rights.

       If output is to a terminal, the effective  rights  comment
       is aligned to column 40. Otherwise, a single tab character
       separates the ACL entry and the effective rights  comment.

   <B>OPTIONS</B>
       <I>--access</I>
           Display the file access control list.

       <I>-d,</I> <I>--default</I>
           Display the default access control list.

       <I>--omit-header</I>
           Do  not  display  the  comment header (the first three
           lines of each file's output).

       <I>--all-effective</I>
           Print all effective rights comments, even if identical
           to the rights defined by the ACL entry.

       <I>--no-effective</I>
           Do not print effective rights comments.

       <I>--skip-base</I>
           Skip files that only have the base ACL entries (owner,
           group, others).

       <I>-R,</I> <I>--recursive</I>
           List the ACLs of  all  files  and  directories  recur­
           sively.

       <I>-L,</I> <I>--logical</I>
           Logical  walk,  follow  symbolic  links.  The  default
           behavior is to follow symbolic link arguments, and  to
           skip symbolic links encountered in subdirectories.

       <I>-P,</I> <I>--physical</I>
           Physical  walk,  skip  all  symbolic  links. This also
           skips symbolic link arguments.

       <I>--tabular</I>
           Use an alternative tabular output format. The ACL  and
           the  default  ACL  are displayed side by side. Permis­
           sions that are ineffective due to the ACL  mask  entry
           are displayed capitalized. The entry tag names for the
           ACL_USER_OBJ and ACL_GROUP_OBJ entries are  also  dis­
           played  in  capital  letters,  which helps in spotting
           those entries.

       <I>--absolute-names</I>
           Do not  strip  leading  slash  characters  (`/').  The
           default behavior is to strip leading slash characters.

       <I>--version</I>
           Print the version of getfacl and exit.

       <I>--help</I>
       The default ACL is only printed if the <I>-d</I> option is given.
       If  no command line parameter is given, <I>getfacl</I> behaves as
       if it was invoked as ``getfacl -''.
