<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>Last</B>  searches back through the file <B>/var/log/wtmp</B> (or the
       file designated by the <B>-f</B> flag) and displays a list of all
       users  logged  in  (and  out) since that file was created.
       Names of users and tty's can be given, in which case  <B>last</B>
       will  show  only  those  entries  matching  the arguments.
       Names of ttys can be abbreviated, thus <B>last</B> <B>0</B> is the  same
       as <B>last</B> <B>tty0</B>.

       When <B>last</B> catches a SIGINT signal (generated by the inter­
       rupt key, usually control-C) or a SIGQUIT  signal  (gener­
       ated  by  the quit key, usually control-\), <B>last</B> will show
       how far it has searched through the file; in the  case  of
       the SIGINT signal <B>last</B> will then terminate.

       The  pseudo  user  <B>reboot</B>  logs in each time the system is
       rebooted.  Thus <B>last</B> <B>reboot</B> will show a log of all reboots
       since the log file was created.

       <B>Lastb</B> is the same as <B>last</B>, except that by default it shows
       a log of the file <B>/var/log/btmp</B>, which  contains  all  the
       bad login attempts.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-</B><I>num</I>   This  is  a  count  telling  <B>last</B> how many lines to
              show.

       <B>-n</B> <I>num</I> The same.

       <B>-R</B>     Suppresses the display of the hostname field.

       <B>-a</B>     Display the hostname in the last column. Useful  in
              combination with the next flag.

       <B>-d</B>     For  non-local  logins,  Linux  stores not only the
              host name of the remote host but its IP  number  as
              well.  This  option  translates  the IP number back
              into a hostname.

       <B>-i</B>     This option is like <B>-d</B> in that it displays  the  IP
              number  of  the remote host, but it displays the IP
              number in numbers-and-dots notation.

       <B>-o</B>     Read an old-type wtmp file (written by  linux-libc5
              applications).
