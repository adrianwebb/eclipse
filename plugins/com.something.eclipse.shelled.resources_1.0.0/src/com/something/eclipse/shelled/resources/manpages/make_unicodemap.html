<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This tool is part of the Samba suite.

       <B>make_unicodemap</B>  compiles  text  unicode  map  files  into
       binary unicode map files for use with  the  international­
       ization features of Samba 2.2.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>codepage</B>
              This  is  the codepage or UNIX character set we are
              processing (a number, e.g. 850).

       <B>inputfile</B>
              This is the input file to process. This is  a  text
              unicode  map  file  such  as  the ones found in the
              Samba <I>source/codepages</I> directory.

       <B>outputfile</B>
              This is the binary output file to produce.

<H2>SAMBA UNICODE MAP FILES</H2><PRE>
       A text Samba unicode map file is a description that  tells
       Samba how to map characters from a specified DOS code page
       or UNIX character set to 16 bit unicode.

       A binary Samba unicode map file is a binary representation
       of  the same information, including a value that specifies
       what codepage or UNIX character set this file is  describ­
       ing.


</PRE>
<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>
       <I>CP&lt;codepage&gt;.TXT</I>

       These  are  the input (text) unicode map files provided in
       the Samba <I>source/codepages</I> directory.

       A text unicode map file consists of  multiple  lines  con­
       taining two fields. These fields are :

       · <I>character</I>  - which is the (hex) character mapped on this
         line.

       · <I>unicode</I> - which is the (hex) 16  bit  unicode  character
         that the character will map to.

       <I>unicode</I><B>_</B><I>map.&lt;codepage&gt;</I>  -  These  are  the output (binary)
       unicode map files produced and placed in the Samba  desti­
       nation <I>lib/codepage</I> directory.

<H2>AUTHOR</H2><PRE>
       The original Samba software  and  related  utilities  were
       created  by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the
       Samba Team as an Open Source project similar  to  the  way
       the Linux kernel is developed.

       The  original  Samba  man pages were written by Karl Auer.
       The  man  page  sources  were  converted  to  YODL  format
       (another  excellent  piece of Open Source software, avail­
       able          at           ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/
       &lt;URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/&gt;) and updated for the
       Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy  Allison.  The  conversion  to
       DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
