<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>dumpkeys</B>  writes, to the standard output, the current con­
       tents of the keyboard driver's translation tables, in  the
       format specified by <B>keymaps(5)</B>.

       Using the various options, the format of the output can be
       controlled and also other information from the kernel  and
       the  programs <B>dumpkeys(1)</B> and <B>loadkeys(1)</B> can be obtained.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-h</B> <B>--help</B>
              Prints the program's version  number  and  a  short
              usage  message to the program's standard error out­
              put and exits.

       <B>-i</B> <B>--short-info</B>
              Prints some characteristics of  the  kernel's  key­
              board driver. The items shown are:

              Keycode range supported by the kernel

                     This tells what values can be used after the
                     <B>keycode</B>  keyword  in  keytable  files.   See
                     <B>keymaps(5)</B> for more information and the syn­
                     tax of these files.

              Number of actions bindable to a key

                     This tells how many different actions a sin­
                     gle  key  can  output using various modifier
                     keys. If the value is 16  for  example,  you
                     can  define  up to 16 different actions to a
                     key combined with modifiers. When the  value
                     is  16, the kernel probably knows about four
                     modifier keys, which you can press  in  dif­
                     ferent  combinations  with the key to access
                     all the bound actions.

              Ranges of action codes supported by the kernel

                     This item contains a  list  of  action  code
                     ranges  in  hexadecimal notation.  These are
                     the values that can be  used  in  the  right
                     hand  side of a key definition, ie. the <I>vv</I>'s
                     in a line

                             <B>keycode</B> <I>xx</I> = <I>vv</I> <I>vv</I> <I>vv</I> <I>vv</I>

                     the  range list with the action symbol list,
                     see option <B>--long-info</B> below.

              Number of function keys supported by kernel

                     This tells the number of action  codes  that
                     can be used to output strings of characters.
                     These action codes are  traditionally  bound
                     to  the various function and editing keys of
                     the keyboard and are defined to  send  stan­
                     dard  escape  sequences.  However,  you  can
                     redefine these to send common command lines,
                     email addresses or whatever you like.  Espe­
                     cially if the number of this item is greater
                     than the number of function and editing keys
                     in your keyboard, you may have some  "spare"
                     action codes that you can bind to AltGr-let­
                     ter combinations, for example, to send  some
                     useful  strings.  See  <B>loadkeys(1)</B>  for more
                     details.

              Function strings

                     You can see you current function key defini­
                     tions with the command

                             <B>dumpkeys</B> <B>--funcs-only</B>



       <B>-l</B> <B>--long-info</B>
              This  option  instructs  <B>dumpkeys</B>  to  print a long
              information listing. The output is the same as with
              the  <B>--short-info</B>  appended with the list of action
              symbols supported by <B>loadkeys(1)</B>  and  <B>dumpkeys(1)</B>,
              along with the symbols' numeric values.


       <B>-n</B> <B>--numeric</B>
              This  option causes <B>dumpkeys</B> to by-pass the conver­
              sion of action code values to symbolic notation and
              to print the in hexadecimal format instead.


       <B>-f</B> <B>--full-table</B>
              This makes <B>dumpkeys</B> skip all the short-hand heuris­
              tics (see <B>keymaps(5)</B>) and output the  key  bindings
              in   the  canonical  form.  First  a  keymaps  line
              describing the currently defined modifier  combina­
              tions  is  printed.  Then for each key a row with a
              column for each modifier  combination  is  printed.
              For  example,  if  the  current  keymap in use uses
              When this option is given, <B>dumpkeys</B> prints only the
              key bindings. Normally <B>dumpkeys</B> prints both the key
              bindings and the string definitions.


       <B>--compose-only</B>
              When this option is given, <B>dumpkeys</B> prints only the
              compose key combinations.  This option is available
              only if your kernel has compose key support.


       <B>-c</B><I>charset</I>  <B>--charset=</B><I>charset</I>
              This instructs <B>dumpkeys</B> to interpret character code
              values  according  to  the specified character set.
              This affects only the translation of character code
              values  to symbolic names. Valid values for <I>charset</I>
              currently are <B>iso-8859-X</B>, Where X  is  a  digit  in
              1-9.   If  no  <I>charset</I>  is specified, <B>iso-8859-1</B> is
              used as a default.  This option produces an  output
              line  `charset  "iso-8859-X"', telling loadkeys how
              to interpret the keymap. (For  example,  "division"
              is 0xf7 in iso-8859-1 but 0xba in iso-8859-8.)
