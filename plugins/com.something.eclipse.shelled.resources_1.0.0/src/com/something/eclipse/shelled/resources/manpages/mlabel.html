<H2>Note of warning</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation, and may  not  be  entirely
       accurate  or  complete.   See the end of this man page for
       details.

<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       The mlabel command adds a volume label to a disk. Its syn­
       tax is:
       mlabel [-vcsn] [-N <I>serial</I>] <I>drive</I>:[<I>new</I><B>_</B><I>label</I>]


       Mlabel  displays  the current volume label, if present. If
       <I>new</I><B>_</B><I>label</I> is not given, and if neither the  c  nor  the  s
       options  are  set,  it  prompts  the user for a new volume
       label.  To delete an existing volume label,  press  return
       at the prompt.

       Reasonable  care  is taken to create a valid MS-DOS volume
       label.  If an invalid label is specified,  mlabel  changes
       the  label (and displays the new label if the verbose mode
       is set). Mlabel returns 0 on success or 1 on failure.

       Mlabel supports the following options:

       c      Clears an existing  label,  without  prompting  the
              user

       s      Shows  the  existing  label,  without prompting the
              user.

       n      Assigns a new (random) serial number to the disk

       N <I>serial</I>
              Sets the supplied serial number. The serial  number
              should  be  supplied as an 8 digit hexadecimal num­
              ber, without spaces

       This  manpage  has  been  automatically   generated   from
       mtools's  texinfo  documentation. However, this process is
       only approximative, and some items,  such  as  crossrefer­
       ences,  footnotes and indices are lost in this translation
       process.  Indeed, these items have no  appropriate  repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
                     <B>./configure;</B> <B>make</B> <B>html</B>

              A    premade    html    can    be     found     at:
              `http://mtools.linux.lu'      and      also     at:
              `http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/mtools'

       *      To generate an info copy  (browsable  using  emacs'
              info mode), run:

                     <B>./configure;</B> <B>make</B> <B>info</B>



       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.
       Indeed, in the info version certain examples are difficult
       to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
