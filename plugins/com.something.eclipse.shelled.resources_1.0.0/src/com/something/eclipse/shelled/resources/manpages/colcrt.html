<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>Colcrt</B> provides virtual half-line and reverse line feed sequences for
     terminals without such capability, and on which overstriking is destruc­
     tive.  Half-line characters and underlining (changed to dashing `-') are
     placed on new lines in between the normal output lines.

     Available options:

     <B>-</B>       Suppress all underlining.  This option is especially useful for
             previewing <I>allboxed</I> tables from <B>tbl(1)</B>.

     <B>-2</B>      Causes all half-lines to be printed, effectively double spacing
             the output.  Normally, a minimal space output format is used
             which will suppress empty lines.  The program never suppresses
             two consecutive empty lines, however.  The <B>-2</B> option is useful
             for sending output to the line printer when the output contains
             superscripts and subscripts which would otherwise be invisible.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     Should fold underlines onto blanks even with the `<B>-</B>' option so that a
     true underline character would show.

     Can't back up more than 102 lines.

     General overstriking is lost; as a special case `|' overstruck with `-'
     or underline becomes `+'.

     Lines are trimmed to 132 characters.

     Some provision should be made for processing superscripts and subscripts
     in documents which are already double-spaced.
