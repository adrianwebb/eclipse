<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>Sed</I>  is  a stream editor.  A stream editor is used to per­
       form basic text transformations on an input stream (a file
       or  input from a pipeline).  While in some ways similar to
       an editor which permits scripted edits (such as  <I>ed</I>),  <I>sed</I>
       works  by  making  only one pass over the input(s), and is
       consequently more efficient.  But it is <I>sed</I>'s  ability  to
       filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes
       it from other types of editors.



</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <I>Sed</I>  may  be  invoked  with  the  following   command-line
       options:

       <B>-V</B>

       <B>--version</B>
              Print  out the version of <I>sed</I> that is being run and
              a copyright notice, then exit.

       <B>-h</B>

       <B>--help</B> Print a usage  message  briefly  summarizing  these
              command-line options and the bug-reporting address,
              then exit.

       <B>-n</B>

       <B>--quiet</B>

       <B>--silent</B>
              By default, <I>sed</I> will print out the pattern space at
              the  end  of  each cycle through the script.  These
              options disable this automatic  printing,  and  <I>sed</I>
              will  only  produce  output when explicitly told to
              via the <B>p</B> command.

       <B>-l</B><I>N</I>

       <B>--line-length=</B><I>N</I>
              Specify the desired line-wrap length  for  the  'l'
              command.   A length of 0 (zero) means to never wrap
              long lines.

       <B>-f</B> <I>script-file</I>

       <B>--file=</B><I>script-file</I>
              Add  the commands contained in the file <I>script-file</I>
              to the set of commands to be run  while  processing
              the input.

       If  no  <B>-e</B>,<B>-f</B>,<B>--expression</B>, or <B>--file</B> options are given on
       the command-line, then the first  non-option  argument  on
       the command line is taken to be the <I>script</I> to be executed.

       If any command-line parameters remain after processing the
       above,  these  parameters  are interpreted as the names of
       input files to be processed.  A file name of <B>-</B>  refers  to
       the  standard  input stream.  The standard input will pro­
       cessed if no file names are specified.



</PRE>
<H2>Command Synopsis</H2><PRE>
       This is just a brief synopsis of <I>sed</I> commands to serve  as
       a reminder to those who already know <I>sed</I>; other documenta­
       tion (such as the texinfo document) must be consulted  for
       fuller descriptions.

   <B>Zero-address</B> <B>``commands''</B>
       : <I>label</I>
              Label for <B>b</B> and <B>t</B> commands.

       #<I>comment</I>
              The  comment extends until the next newline (or the
              end of a <B>-e</B> script fragment).

       }      The closing bracket of a { } block.

   <B>Zero-</B> <B>or</B> <B>One-</B> <B>address</B> <B>commands</B>
       =      Print the current line number.

       a \

       <I>text</I>   Append <I>text</I>, which has each embedded  newline  pre­
              ceded by a backslash.

       i \

       <I>text</I>   Insert  <I>text</I>,  which has each embedded newline pre­
              ceded by a backslash.

       q      Immediately quit the <I>sed</I> script without  processing
              any  more  input,  except that if auto-print is not
              disabled the current pattern space will be printed.

              branch to end of script.

       c \

       <I>text</I>   Replace  the  selected  lines  with <I>text</I>, which has
              each embedded newline preceded by a backslash.

       d      Delete pattern space.  Start next cycle.

       D      Delete up to the first embedded newline in the pat­
              tern  space.   Start  next  cycle, but skip reading
              from the input if there is still data in  the  pat­
              tern space.

       h H    Copy/append pattern space to hold space.

       g G    Copy/append hold space to pattern space.

       x      Exchange  the  contents  of  the  hold  and pattern
              spaces.

       l      List out the current line in a ``visually unambigu­
              ous'' form.

       n N    Read/append the next line of input into the pattern
              space.

       p      Print the current pattern space.

       P      Print up to the first embedded newline of the  cur­
              rent pattern space.

       s/<I>regexp</I>/<I>replacement</I>/
              Attempt  to match <I>regexp</I> against the pattern space.
              If successful, replace that  portion  matched  with
              <I>replacement</I>.   The <I>replacement</I> may contain the spe­
              cial character <B>&amp;</B> to refer to that  portion  of  the
              pattern   space  which  matched,  and  the  special
              escapes \1 through \9 to refer to the corresponding
              matching sub-expressions in the <I>regexp</I>.

       w      <I>filename</I>  Write  the current pattern space to <I>file­</I>
              <I>name</I>.

       y/<I>source</I>/<I>dest</I>/
              Transliterate the characters in the  pattern  space
              which appear in <I>source</I> to the corresponding charac­
              ter in <I>dest</I>.


</PRE>
<H2>Addresses</H2><PRE>
       <I>Sed</I> commands can be given with no addresses, in which case
       the command will be executed for all input lines; with one
       mand shall only be executed if the  address  (or  address-
       range) does <B>not</B> match.

       The following address types are supported:

       <I>number</I> Match only the specified line <I>number</I>.

       <I>first</I>~<I>step</I>
              Match  every <I>step</I>'th line starting with line <I>first</I>.
              For example, ``sed -n 1~2p''  will  print  all  the
              odd-numbered  lines  in  the  input stream, and the
              address 2~5 will match every fifth  line,  starting
              with the second.  (This is a GNU extension.)

       $      Match the last line.

       /<I>regexp</I>/
              Match lines matching the regular expression <I>regexp</I>.

       \<B>c</B><I>regexp</I><B>c</B>
              Match lines matching the regular expression <I>regexp</I>.
              The <B>c</B> may be any character.

       GNU <I>sed</I> also supports some special 2-address forms:

       0,<I>addr2</I>
              Start  out  in "matched first address" state, until
              <I>addr2</I> is found.  This is similar to 1,<I>addr2</I>, except
              that  if <I>addr2</I> matches the very first line of input
              the 0,<I>addr2</I> form will be at the end of  its  range,
              whereas  the  1,<I>addr2</I>  form  will  still  be at the
              beginning of its range.

       <I>addr1</I>,+<I>N</I>
              Will match <I>addr1</I> and the <I>N</I> lines following <I>addr1</I>.

       <I>addr1</I>,~<I>N</I>
              Will match <I>addr1</I>  and  the  lines  following  <I>addr1</I>
              until  the  next  line whose input line number is a
              multiple of <I>N</I>.


</PRE>
<H2>Regular expressions</H2><PRE>
       POSIX.2 BREs <I>should</I> be supported,  but  they  aren't  com­
       pletely  yet.   The  <B>\n</B>  sequence  in a regular expression
       matches the newline character.  There are  also  some  GNU
       extensions.   [XXX  FIXME:  more needs to be said.  At the
       very  least,  a  reference  to  another   document   which
       describes what is supported should be given.]


</PRE>
<H2>Miscellaneous notes</H2><PRE>
       This  version of <I>sed</I> supports a \<B>&lt;newline&gt;</B> sequence in all
       regular expressions, the <I>replacement</I> part of a  substitute
       sion'' in the body of your report if at all possible.
