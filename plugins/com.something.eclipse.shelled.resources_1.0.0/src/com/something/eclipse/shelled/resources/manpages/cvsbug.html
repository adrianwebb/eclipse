<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>cvsbug</B> is a tool used to submit <I>problem</I> <I>reports</I> (PRs) to a
       central support site.  In most cases the correct <I>site</I> will
       be the default.  This argument indicates the support  site
       which is responsible for the category of problem involved.
       Some sites may use a local address  as  a  default.   <I>site</I>
       values are defined by using the <B>aliases(5)</B>.

       <B>cvsbug</B>  invokes  an  editor  on  a problem report template
       (after trying to  fill  in  some  fields  with  reasonable
       default  values).   When you exit the editor, <B>cvsbug</B> sends
       the completed form to the <I>Problem</I> <I>Report</I> <I>Management</I> <I>System</I>
       (<B>GNATS</B>)  at  a central support site.  At the support site,
       the PR is assigned a unique number and is  stored  in  the
       <B>GNATS</B> database according to its category and submitter-id.
       <B>GNATS</B> automatically replies with an acknowledgement,  cit­
       ing the category and the PR number.

       To ensure that a PR is handled promptly, it should contain
       your (unique) <I>submitter-id</I> and one of the available  <I>cate­</I>
       <I>gories</I>  to identify the problem area.  (Use <B>`cvsbug</B> <B>-L'</B> to
       see a list of categories.)

       The <B>cvsbug</B> template at your site should  already  be  cus­
       tomized  with your submitter-id (running `<B>install-sid</B> <I>sub­</I>
       <I>mitter-id</I>' to accomplish this is part of the  installation
       procedures  for  <B>cvsbug</B>).   If  this hasn't been done, see
       your  system  administrator  for  your  submitter-id,   or
       request  one  from  your  support site by invoking <B>`cvsbug</B>
       <B>--request-id'.</B>  If your site does not distinguish  between
       different  user  sites,  or if you are not affiliated with
       the support site, use <B>`net'</B> for this field.

       The more precise your problem  description  and  the  more
       complete  your  information,  the faster your support team
       can solve your problems.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-f</B> <I>problem-report</I>
              specify a file (<I>problem-report</I>) which already  con­
              tains  a complete problem report.  <B>cvsbug</B> sends the
              contents of the file without invoking  the  editor.
              If the value for <I>problem-report</I> is <B>`-'</B>, then <B>cvsbug</B>
              reads from standard input.

       <B>-t</B> <I>mail-address</I>
              Change mail address at the support site for problem
              specified, with a request  for  your  <I>submitter-id</I>.
              If  you are not affiliated with <I>site</I>, use a <I>submit­</I>
              <I>ter-id</I> of <B>net</B>'.

       <B>-v</B>     Display the <B>cvsbug</B> version number.

       Note: use <B>cvsbug</B> to submit  problem  reports  rather  than
       mailing them directly.  Using both the template and <B>cvsbug</B>
       itself will help ensure  all  necessary  information  will
       reach the support site.


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
       The  environment  variable  <B>EDITOR</B> specifies the editor to
       invoke on the template.
       default: <B>vi</B>

       If the environment variable <B>PR_FORM</B> is set, then its value
       is used as the file name of the template for your problem-
       report editing session.  You can use this to start with  a
       partially  completed  form  (for  example, a form with the
       identification fields already completed).


</PRE>
<H2>HOW TO FILL OUT A PROBLEM REPORT</H2><PRE>
       Problem reports have to be in a particular form so that  a
       program  can easily manage them.  Please remember the fol­
       lowing guidelines:

       ·  describe only <B>one</B> <B>problem</B> with each problem report.

       ·  For follow-up mail, use the same subject  line  as  the
          one  in  the  automatic acknowledgement. It consists of
          category, PR number and  the  original  synopsis  line.
          This  allows  the  support  site to relate several mail
          messages to a particular PR and to record them automat­
          ically.

       ·  Please try to be as accurate as possible in the subject
          and/or synopsis line.

       ·  The subject and the synopsis line are not confidential.
          This is because open-bugs lists are compiled from them.
          Avoid confidential information there.

       See the GNU <B>Info</B> file <B>cvsbug.info</B> or the document  <I>Report­</I>
       <I>ing</I>  <I>Problems</I>  <I>With</I>  <I>cvsbug</I> for  detailed  information  on
       reporting problems


</PRE>
<H2>HOW TO SUBMIT TEST CASES, CODE, ETC.</H2><PRE>
       Submit small code samples with the PR.  Contact  the  sup­
       port site for instructions on submitting larger test cases
       and problematic source code.
