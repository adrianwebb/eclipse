<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>Dialog</B> is a program that will let you to present a variety
       of questions or display messages using dialog boxes from a
       shell script.  These types of dialog boxes are implemented
       (though not all are necessarily compiled into <B>dialog</B>):

              <B>calendar</B>,  <B>checklist</B>,  <B>fselect</B>,   <B>gauge</B>,   <B>infobox</B>,
              <B>inputbox</B>,  <B>menu</B>,  <B>msgbox</B> (message), <B>password</B>, <B>radi­</B>
              <B>olist</B>, <B>tailbox</B>, <B>tailboxbg</B>,  <B>textbox</B>,  <B>timebox</B>,  and
              <B>yesno</B> (yes/no).

       You can put more than one dialog box into a script:

       -    Use the <B>--and-widget</B> token to force Dialog to proceed
            to the next dialog unless you  have  pressed  ESC  to
            cancel, or

       -    Simply add the tokens for the next dialog box, making
            a chain.  Dialog stops chaining when the return  code
            from a dialog is nonzero, e.g., Cancel or No.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>Common</B> <B>Options</B>

       <B>--aspect</B> <I>ratio</I>
              This gives you some control over the box dimensions
              when using auto sizing (specifying 0 for height and
              width).  It represents width / height.  The default
              is 9, which means 9 characters wide to every 1 line
              high.

       <B>--backtitle</B> <I>backtitle</I>
              Specifies a <I>backtitle</I> string to be displayed on the
              backdrop, at the top of the screen.

       <B>--beep</B> Sound the audible alarm each  time  the  screen  is
              refreshed.

       <B>--beep-after</B>
              Beep if input is interrupted, e.g., by a control/C.

       <B>--begin</B> <I>y</I> <I>x</I>
              Specify the position of the upper left corner of  a
              dialog box on the screen.

       <B>--cancel-label</B> <I>string</I>
              'r',  reset by 'R'.  Underline is set by 'u', reset
              by  'U'.   The  settings  are   cumulative,   e.g.,
              "\Zb\Z1"  makes  the  following  text  bright  red.
              Restore normal settings with "\Zn".


       <B>--cr-wrap</B>
              Interpret embedded newlines in the dialog text as a
              newline on the screen.  Otherwise, <B>dialog</B> will only
              wrap lines where needed to fit inside the text box.
              Even  though you can control line breaks with this,
              <B>dialog</B> will still wrap any lines that are too  long
              for  the  width  of  the box.  Without cr-wrap, the
              layout of your text may be formatted to  look  nice
              in the source code of your script without affecting
              the way it will look in the dialog.

       <B>--create-rc</B> <I>file</I>
              When <B>dialog</B> supports run-time  configuration,  this
              can  be used to dump a sample configuration file to
              the file specified by <I>file</I>.

       <B>--defaultno</B>
              Make the default value of the <B>yes/no</B> box a <B>No</B>.

       <B>--default-item</B> <I>string</I>
              Set the default item in a menu box.   Normally  the
              first item in the box is the default.

       <B>--exit-label</B> <I>string</I>
              Override the label used for "EXIT" buttons.

       <B>--extra-button</B>
              Show  an  extra  button, between ok/cancel and help
              buttons.

       <B>--extra-label</B> <I>string</I>
              Override the label used for "Extra" buttons.

       <B>--help</B> Prints the help message  to  standard  error.   The
              help message is printed if no options are given.

       <B>--help-button</B>
              Show  a  help-button after ok/cancel buttons, i.e.,
              in checklist, radiolist and menu boxes.  If <B>--item-</B>
              <B>help</B>  is also given, on exit the return status will
              be the same as for the "Ok" button, and  the  item-
              help  text  will be written to standard error after
              the token "HELP".   Otherwise,  the  return  status
              will indicate that the Help button was pressed, and
              no message printed.


       <B>--max-input</B> <I>size</I>
              Limit input strings to  the  given  size.   If  not
              specified, the limit is 2000.

       <B>--no-cancel</B>

       <B>--nocancel</B>
              Suppress the "Cancel" button in checklist, inputbox
              and menu box modes.  A script can still test if the
              user pressed the ESC key to cancel to quit.

       <B>--no-collapse</B>
              Normally <B>dialog</B> converts tabs to spaces and reduces
              multiple spaces to a single space for text which is
              displayed in a message boxes, etc.  Use this option
              to disable that feature.   Note  that  <B>dialog</B>  will
              still wrap text, subject to the <B>--cr-wrap</B> option.

       <B>--no-kill</B>
              Tells  <B>dialog</B> to put the <B>tailboxbg</B> box in the back­
              ground, printing its process id to standard  error.
              SIGHUP is disabled for the background process.

       <B>--no-shadow</B>
              Suppress  shadows  that would be drawn to the right
              and bottom of each dialog box.

       <B>--ok-label</B> <I>string</I>
              Override the label used for "OK" buttons.

       <B>--output-fd</B> <I>fd</I>
              Direct output to the given file  descriptor.   Most
              <B>dialog</B>  scripts  write  to  the standard error, but
              error messages may also be written there, depending
              on your script.

       <B>--print-maxsize</B>
              Print  the  maximum size of dialog boxes, i.e., the
              screen size, to the standard error.   This  may  be
              used alone, without other options.

       <B>--print-size</B>
              Prints  the  size  of  each  dialog box to standard
              error.

       <B>--print-version</B>
              Prints <B>dialog</B>'s version to  standard  error.   This
              may be used alone, without other options.

       <B>--separate-output</B>
              For  checklist widgets, output result one line at a

       <B>--size-err</B>
              Check the resulting size of  a  dialog  box  before
              trying to use it, printing the resulting size if it
              is larger than the screen.  (This option  is  obso­
              lete, since all new-window calls are checked).

       <B>--sleep</B> <I>secs</I>
              Sleep (delay) for the given number of seconds after
              processing a dialog box.

       <B>--stderr</B>
              Direct output to the standard error.  This  is  the
              default,   since   curses  normally  writes  screen
              updates to the standard output.

       <B>--stdout</B>
              Direct output to the standard output.

       <B>--tab-correct</B>
              Convert each tab character to one or  more  spaces.
              Otherwise,  tabs  are  rendered  according  to  the
              curses library's interpretation.

       <B>--tab-len</B> <I>n</I>
              Specify the number of spaces that a  tab  character
              occupies  if  the  "<B>--tab-correct</B>" option is given.
              The default is 8.

       <B>--timeout</B> <I>secs</I>
              Timeout (exit with error code) if no user  response
              within the given number of seconds.

       <B>--title</B> <I>title</I>
              Specifies a <I>title</I> string to be displayed at the top
              of the dialog box.

       <B>--trim</B> eliminate leading blanks, trim literal newlines and
              repeated blanks from message text.

       <B>--version</B>
              Same as "<B>--print-version</B>".

       <B>Box</B> <B>Options</B>
              All dialog boxes have at least three parameters:

              <I>text</I> the caption or contents of the box.

              <I>height</I>
                   the height of the dialog box.

              <I>width</I>
                   the width of the dialog box.

              date is printed in the form day/month/year.

       <B>--checklist</B>  <I>text</I> <I>height</I> <I>width</I> <I>list-height</I> [ <I>tag</I> <I>item</I> <I>sta­</I>
       <I>tus</I> ] <I>...</I>
              A <B>checklist</B> box is similar to a <B>menu</B> box; there are
              multiple entries presented in the form of  a  menu.
              Instead  of  choosing  one entry among the entries,
              each entry can be turned on or  off  by  the  user.
              The initial on/off state of each entry is specified
              by <I>status</I>.  On exit, a list of the <I>tag</I>  strings  of
              those entries that are turned on will be printed on
              <I>stderr</I>.

       <B>--fselect</B>  <I>filepath</I> <I>height</I> <I>width</I>
              The file-selection  dialog  displays  a  text-entry
              window  in which you can type a filename (or direc­
              tory), and above that two  windows  with  directory
              names and filenames.

              Here  <B>filepath</B>  can be a filepath in which case the
              file and directory windows will  display  the  con­
              tents  of  the  path and the text-entry window will
              contain the preselected filename.

              Use tab or arrow keys to move between the  windows.
              Within  the  directory or filename windows, use the
              up/down arrow keys to scroll the current selection.
              Use  the  space-bar  to  copy the current selection
              into the text-entry window.

              Typing any printable characters switches  focus  to
              the  text-entry  window, entering that character as
              well as scrolling the directory and  filename  win­
              dows to the closest match.

              Use  a carriage return or the "OK" button to accept
              the current value in the text-entry window, or  the
              "Cancel" button to cancel.


       <B>--gauge</B> <I>text</I> <I>height</I> <I>width</I> <I>[percent]</I>
              A  <B>gauge</B>  box  displays a meter along the bottom of
              the box.  The meter indicates the percentage.   New
              percentages are read from standard input, one inte­
              ger per line.  The meter is updated to reflect each
              new  percentage.   If stdin is XXX, then subsequent
              lines up to another XXX are used for a new  prompt.
              The gauge exits when EOF is reached on stdin.

              The  <I>percent</I>  value  denotes the initial percentage
              shown in the meter.  If not specified, it is  zero.

              tialize   the  input  string.   When  entering  the
              string, the <I>BACKSPACE</I> key can be  used  to  correct
              typing  errors.  If the input string is longer than
              can fit in the dialog box, the input field will  be
              scrolled.   On  exit,  the  input  string  will  be
              printed on <I>stderr</I>.

       <B>--menu</B> <I>text</I> <I>height</I> <I>width</I> <I>menu-height</I> [ <I>tag</I> <I>item</I> ] <I>...</I>
              As its name suggests, a <B>menu</B> box is  a  dialog  box
              that  can  be  used to present a list of choices in
              the form of a menu for the user to choose.  Choices
              are  displayed in the order given.  Each menu entry
              consists of a <I>tag</I> string and an <I>item</I>  string.   The
              <I>tag</I>  gives  the entry a name to distinguish it from
              the other entries in the menu.  The <I>item</I> is a short
              description  of  the  option  that the entry repre­
              sents.  The user can move between the menu  entries
              by  pressing  the <I>UP/DOWN</I> keys, the first letter of
              the <I>tag</I> as a hot-key, or the number keys <I>1-9</I>. There
              are  <I>menu-height</I>  entries  displayed in the menu at
              one time, but the menu will be  scrolled  if  there
              are more entries than that.  When <B>dialog</B> exits, the
              <I>tag</I> of the chosen menu entry  will  be  printed  on
              <I>stderr</I>.   If the <B>--help-button</B> option is given, the
              corresponding help text will be printed if the user
              selects the help button.

       <B>--msgbox</B> <I>text</I> <I>height</I> <I>width</I>
              A <B>message</B> box is very similar to a <B>yes/no</B> box.  The
              only difference between a <B>message</B> box and a  <B>yes/no</B>
              box is that a <B>message</B> box has only a single <B>OK</B> but­
              ton.  You can use this dialog box  to  display  any
              message  you  like.  After reading the message, the
              user can press the <I>ENTER</I> key so  that  <B>dialog</B>  will
              exit  and the calling shell script can continue its
              operation.

       <B>--passwordbox</B> <I>text</I> <I>height</I> <I>width</I> <I>[init]</I>
              A <B>password</B> box is similar to an input  box,  except
              that  the  text  the  user enters is not displayed.
              This is useful  when  prompting  for  passwords  or
              other sensitive information.  Be aware that if any­
              thing is passed in "init", it will  be  visible  in
              the  system's  process  table  to  casual snoopers.
              Also, it is very confusing to the user  to  provide
              them  with a default password they cannot see.  For
              these reasons, using "init" is highly  discouraged.

       <B>--radiolist</B> <I>text</I> <I>height</I> <I>width</I> <I>list-height</I>  [ <I>tag</I> <I>item</I> <I>sta­</I>
       <I>tus</I> ] <I>...</I>
              A <B>radiolist</B> box is similar to a <B>menu</B> box.  The only
              difference is that you can indicate which entry  is
              the  tailboxbg widgets in the same process, polling
              for updates.  You may use a tab to traverse between
              the widgets on the screen, and close them individu­
              ally, e.g., by pressing <I>ENTER</I>.  Once the  non-tail­
              boxbg  widgets  are  closed, dialog forks a copy of
              itself into the background, and prints its  process
              id if the <B>--no-kill</B> option is given.

              NOTE:  Older  versions of dialog forked immediately
              and attempted to update  the  screen  individually.
              Besides  being  bad for performance, it was unwork­
              able.  Some older scripts  may  not  work  properly
              with the polled scheme.

       <B>--textbox</B> <B>file</B> <B>height</B> <B>width</B>
              A  <B>text</B> box lets you display the contents of a text
              file in a dialog box.  It is  like  a  simple  text
              file viewer.  The user can move through the file by
              using the  <I>UP/DOWN</I>,  <I>PGUP/PGDN</I>  and  <I>HOME/END</I>  keys
              available  on most keyboards.  If the lines are too
              long to be displayed in  the  box,  the  <I>LEFT/RIGHT</I>
              keys can be used to scroll the text region horizon­
              tally.  You may also use vi-style keys h, j,  k,  l
              in place of the cursor keys, and B or N in place of
              the pageup/pagedown keys.   For  more  convenience,
              vi-style  forward  and backward searching functions
              are also provided.

       <B>--timebox</B> <I>text</I> <I>height</I> <I>[width</I> <I>hour</I> <I>minute</I> <I>second]</I>
              A dialog is displayed which allows  you  to  select
              hour,  minute  and second.  If the values for hour,
              minute or second are missing or negative, the  cur­
              rent date's corresponding values are used.  You can
              increment or  decrement  any  of  those  using  the
              left-,  up-,  right-  and  down-arrows.  Use tab or
              backtab to move  between  windows.   On  exit,  the
              result is printed in the form hour:minute:second.

       <B>--yesno</B> <I>text</I> <I>height</I> <I>width</I>
              A  <B>yes/no</B>  dialog  box of size <I>height</I> rows by <I>width</I>
              columns will be displayed.  The string specified by
              <I>text</I>  is  displayed inside the dialog box.  If this
              string is too long to fit in one line, it  will  be
              automatically divided into multiple lines at appro­
              priate places.  The <I>text</I> string  can  also  contain
              the  sub-string  <I>"\n"</I> or newline characters <I>`\n´</I> to
              control line breaking explicitly.  This dialog  box
              is  useful  for  asking  questions that require the
              user to answer either yes or no.   The  dialog  box
              has a <B>Yes</B> button and a <B>No</B> button, in which the user
              can switch between by pressing the <I>TAB</I> key.

           c)  if  the  file  in  (b) is not found, try using the
               GLOBALRC file determined  at  compile-time,  i.e.,
               <I>/etc/dialogrc</I>.

           d)  if  the  file in (c) is not found, use compiled in
               defaults.

       3.  Edit the sample configuration file and copy it to some
           place that <B>dialog</B> can find, as stated in step 2 above.

<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
       <B>DIALOGRC</B>       Define this variable if you want to specify
                      the  name of the configuration file to use.

       <B>DIALOG_CANCEL</B>

       <B>DIALOG_ERROR</B>

       <B>DIALOG_ESC</B>

       <B>DIALOG_EXTRA</B>

       <B>DIALOG_HELP</B>

       <B>DIALOG_OK</B>      Define any of these variables to change the
                      exit  code  on  Cancel (1), error (-1), ESC
                      (255), Extra (3),  Help  (2),  or  Ok  (0).
                      Normally  shell  scripts cannot distinguish
                      between -1 and 255.

<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
       Exit status is subject to being overridden by  environment
       variables.  Normally they are:

       0    if <B>dialog</B> is exited by pressing the <B>Yes</B> or <B>OK</B> button.

       1    if the <B>No</B> or <B>Cancel</B> button is pressed.

       -1   if errors occur inside <B>dialog</B> or <B>dialog</B> is exited  by
            pressing the <I>ESC</I> key.
