</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>bashbug</B>  is  a  shell  script to help the user compose and
       mail bug reports concerning bash  in  a  standard  format.
       <B>bashbug</B>  invokes  the  editor specified by the environment
       variable <B>EDITOR</B> on a temporary copy of the bug report for­
       mat  outline. The user must fill in the appropriate fields
       and exit the editor.  <B>bashbug</B>  then  mails  the  completed
       report  to  <I>bug-bash@gnu.org</I>,  or  <I>address</I>.  If the report
       cannot be mailed, it is saved in the file <I>dead.bashbug</I>  in
       the invoking user's home directory.

       The  bug  report  format  outline consists of several sec­
       tions.  The first section provides information  about  the
       machine,  operating system, the bash version, and the com­
       pilation environment.  The second section should be filled
       in  with  a  description  of  the  bug.  The third section
       should be a description of how to reproduce the bug.   The
       optional  fourth section is for a proposed fix.  Fixes are
       encouraged.
