<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This  manual  page documents briefly the <B>lessecho</B> command.
       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux dis­
       tribution  because  the  original  program does not have a
       manual page.

       <B>lessecho</B> is a program that simply echos its filename argu­
       ments  on  standard  output.  But  any argument containing
       spaces is enclosed in quotes.
