       <B>h2ph</B> <B>[-d</B> <B>destination</B> <B>directory]</B> <B>[-r</B> <B>|</B> <B>-a]</B> <B>[-l]</B> <B>[header­</B>

</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>h2ph</I> converts any C header files specified to the corre­
       sponding Perl header file format.  It is most easily run
       while in /usr/include:

               cd /usr/include; h2ph * sys/*

       or

               cd /usr/include; h2ph * sys/* arpa/* netinet/*

       or

               cd /usr/include; h2ph -r -l .

       The output files are placed in the hierarchy rooted at
       Perl's architecture dependent library directory.  You can
       specify a different hierarchy with a <B>-d</B> switch.

       If run with no arguments, filters standard input to stan­
       dard output.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       -d destination_dir
           Put the resulting <B>.ph</B> files beneath <B>destination_dir</B>,
           instead of beneath the default Perl library location
           ($Config{'installsitsearch'}).

       -r  Run recursively; if any of <B>headerfiles</B> are directo­
           ries, then run <I>h2ph</I> on all files in those directories
           (and their subdirectories, etc.).  <B>-r</B> and <B>-a</B> are mutu­
           ally exclusive.

       -a  Run automagically; convert <B>headerfiles</B>, as well as any
           <B>.h</B> files which they include.  This option will search
           for <B>.h</B> files in all directories which your C compiler
           ordinarily uses.  <B>-a</B> and <B>-r</B> are mutually exclusive.

       -l  Symbolic links will be replicated in the destination
           directory.  If <B>-l</B> is not specified, then links are
           skipped over.

       -h  Put ``hints'' in the .ph files which will help in
           locating problems with <I>h2ph</I>.  In those cases when you
           <B>require</B> a <B>.ph</B> file containing syntax errors, instead
           of the cryptic

                   [ some error condition ] at (eval mmm) line nnn

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       Doesn't construct the %sizeof array for you.

       It doesn't handle all C constructs, but it does attempt to
       isolate definitions inside evals so that you can get at
       the definitions that it can translate.

       It's only intended as a rough tool.  You may need to
       dicker with the files produced.

       You have to run this program by hand; it's not run as part
       of the Perl installation.

       Doesn't handle complicated expressions built piecemeal, a
       la:

           enum {
               FIRST_VALUE,
               SECOND_VALUE,
           #ifdef ABC
               THIRD_VALUE
           #endif
           };

       Doesn't necessarily locate all of your C compiler's inter­
       nally-defined symbols.
