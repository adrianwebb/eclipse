<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>setserial</B>  is  a program designed to set and/or report the
       configuration information associated with a  serial  port.
       This information includes what I/O port and IRQ a particu­
       lar serial port is using, and whether or not the break key
       should  be interpreted as the Secure Attention Key, and so
       on.

       During the normal bootup process, only COM ports  1-4  are
       initialized,  using  the default I/O ports and IRQ values,
       as listed below.  In order to  initialize  any  additional
       serial  ports,  or  to  change the COM 1-4 ports to a non­
       stadard configuration, the  <B>setserial</B>  program  should  be
       used.   Typically  it  is called from an <I>rc.serial</I> script,
       which is usually run out of <I>/etc/rc.local</I>.

       The <I>device</I> argument  or  arguments  specifies  the  serial
       device  which  should  be  configured or interrogated.  It
       will usually have the following form: <B>/dev/cua[0-3]</B>.

       If no parameters are specified, <B>setserial</B> will  print  out
       the  port  type  (i.e., 8250, 16450, 16550, 16550A, etc.),
       the hardware I/O port, the hardware IRQ  line,  its  "baud
       base," and some of its operational flags.

       If  the <B>-g</B> option is given, the arguments to setserial are
       interpreted as a list of devices for which the  character­
       istics of those devices should be printed.

       Without  the <B>-g</B> option, the first argument to setserial is
       interpreted as the device to be modified  or  characteris­
       tics  to  be  printed,  and  any  additional arguments are
       interpreted as parameters which should be assigned to that
       serial device.

       For  the most part, superuser privilege is required to set
       the configuration parameters of  a  serial  port.   A  few
       serial  port  parameters  can be set by normal users, how­
       ever, and these will be noted as exceptions in this manual
       page.



</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>Setserial</B> accepts the following options:


       <B>-a</B>     When   reporting  the  configuration  of  a  serial
       <B>-v</B>     Be verbose.  <B>Setserial</B> will print additional status
              output.

       <B>-V</B>     Display version and exit.

       <B>-W</B>     Do  wild  interrupt  initialization and exit.  This
              option is no longer relevant in Linux kernels after
              version 2.1.

       <B>-z</B>     Zero  out  the  serial flags before starting to set
              flags.  This is related to the automatic saving  of
              serial flags using the -G flag.



</PRE>
<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       The following parameters can be assigned to a serial port.

       All argument values are assumed to be  in  decimal  unless
       preceeded by "0x".


       <B>port</B> port_number
              The  <B>port</B>  option  sets  the I/O port, as described
              above.

       <B>irq</B> irq_number
              The <B>irq</B> option sets the hardware IRQ, as  described
              above.

       <B>uart</B> uart_type
              This option is used to set the UART type.  The per­
              mitted types are <B>none</B>, 8250, 16450, 16550,  16550A,
              16650,  16650V2,  16654,  16750,  16850, 16950, and
              16954.  Using UART type <B>none</B> will disable the port.

              Some internal modems are billed as having a "16550A
              UART with a 1k buffer".  This is a  lie.   They  do
              not  have  really  have  a  16550A compatible UART;
              instead what they have is a 16450  compatible  UART
              with  a 1k receive buffer to prevent receiver over­
              runs.  This is important, because they do not  have
              a  transmit  FIFO.   Hence, they are not compatible
              with a 16550A UART, and the autoconfiguration  pro­
              cess  will  correctly identify them as 16450's.  If
              you attempt to override this using the <B>uart</B> parame­
              ter,  you  will  see dropped characters during file
              transmissions.  These  UART's  usually  have  other
              problems:  the  <B>skip_test</B> parameter also often must
              be specified.

       <B>autoconfig</B>
              When this parameter is given,  <B>setserial</B>  will  ask
              not to use the  <B>auto_irq</B>  feature,  but  rather  to
              specify  the  IRQ  to be used explicitly, using the
              <B>irq</B> parameter.

       <B>^auto_irq</B>
              During autoconfiguration, do <I>not</I> try  to  determine
              the IRQ.

       <B>skip_test</B>
              During autoconfiguration, skip the UART test.  Some
              internal modems do not have National  Semiconductor
              compatible   UART's,   but  have  cheap  imitations
              instead.  Some of these cheasy imitations UART's do
              not  fully  support  the  loopback  detection mode,
              which is used by the  kernel  to  make  sure  there
              really  is  a  UART  at a particular address before
              attempting to configure it.  So for certain  inter­
              nal  modems you will need to specify this parameter
              so Linux can initialize the UART correctly.

       <B>^skip_test</B>
              During autoconfiguration,  do  <I>not</I>  skip  the  UART
              test.

       <B>baud_base</B> baud_base
              This  option  sets the base baud rate, which is the
              clock frequency divided by 16.  Normally this value
              is  115200,  which  is  also  the fastest baud rate
              which the UART can support.

       <B>spd_hi</B> Use 57.6kb when the  application  requests  38.4kb.
              This parameter may be specified by a non-privileged
              user.

       <B>spd_vhi</B>
              Use 115kb when  the  application  requests  38.4kb.
              This parameter may be specified by a non-privileged
              user.

       <B>spd_shi</B>
              Use 230kb when  the  application  requests  38.4kb.
              This parameter may be specified by a non-privileged
              user.

       <B>spd_warp</B>
              Use 460kb when  the  application  requests  38.4kb.
              This parameter may be specified by a non-privileged
              user.

       <B>spd_cust</B>
              Use the custom divisor to set the  speed  when  the
              application  requests  38.4kb.   In  this case, the
              privileged user.

       <B>sak</B>    Set the break key at the Secure Attention Key.

       <B>^sak</B>   disable the Secure Attention Key.

       <B>fourport</B>
              Configure the port as an AST Fourport card.

       <B>^fourport</B>
              Disable AST Fourport configuration.

       <B>close_delay</B> delay
              Specify the amount of time, in hundredths of a sec­
              ond,  that  DTR  should remain low on a serial line
              after the callout  device  is  closed,  before  the
              blocked   dialin  device  raises  DTR  again.   The
              default value of this option is 50, or a  half-sec­
              ond delay.

       <B>closing_wait</B> delay
              Specify the amount of time, in hundredths of a sec­
              ond, that the kernel should wait  for  data  to  be
              transmitted  from the serial port while closing the
              port.  If "none" is specified, no delay will occur.
              If  "infinite"  is  specified  the kernel will wait
              indefinitely  for the buffered data to be transmit­
              ted.   The default setting is 3000 or 30 seconds of
              delay.  This default is generally  appropriate  for
              most  devices.   If  too  long a delay is selected,
              then the serial port may hang for a  long  time  if
              when  a serial port which is not connected, and has
              data pending, is closed.  If too short a  delay  is
              selected,  then  there  is  a risk that some of the
              transmitted data is output at all.  If  the  device
              is extremely slow, like a plotter, the closing_wait
              may need to be larger.

       <B>session_lockout</B>
              Lock out callout port (/dev/cuaXX) accesses  across
              different  sessions.   That  is, once a process has
              opened a port, do not allow a process with  a  dif­
              ferent session ID to open that port until the first
              process has closed it.

       <B>^session_lockout</B>
              Do not lock out callout port accesses  across  dif­
              ferent sessions.

       <B>pgrp_lockout</B>
              Lock  out callout port (/dev/cuaXX) accesses across
              different process groups.  That is, once a  process
              The  application  of  this parameter is for getty's
              which are blocked on a serial port's dial in  line.
              This allows the getty to reset the modem (which may
              have had its configuration modified by the applica­
              tion  using  the callout device) before blocking on
              the open again.

       <B>^hup_notify</B>
              Do not notify a process blocked on opening  a  dial
              in line when the callout device is hung up.

       <B>split_termios</B>
              Treat  the  termios  settings  used  by the callout
              device and the termios settings used by the  dialin
              devices as separate.

       <B>^split_termios</B>
              Use  the  same  termios structure to store both the
              dialin and callout  ports.   This  is  the  default
              option.

       <B>callout_nohup</B>
              If this particular serial port is opened as a call­
              out device, do not  hangup  the  tty  when  carrier
              detect is dropped.

       <B>^callout_nohup</B>
              Do  not  skip hanging up the tty when a serial port
              is opened as a  callout  device.   Of  course,  the
              HUPCL termios flag must be enabled if the hangup is
              to occur.

       <B>low_latency</B>
              Minimize the receive latency of the  serial  device
              at  the cost of greater CPU utilization.  (Normally
              there is an average of 5-10ms latency before  char­
              acters are handed off to the line discpline to min­
              imize overhead.)  This is off by default, but  cer­
              tain real-time applications may find this useful.

       <B>^low_latency</B>
              Optimize  for  efficient  CPU  processing of serial
              characters at the cost  of  paying  an  average  of
              5-10ms  of  latency  before the characters are pro­
              cessed.  This is the default.


</PRE>
<H2>CONSIDERATIONS OF CONFIGURING SERIAL PORTS</H2><PRE>
       It is important to note that setserial  merely  tells  the
       Linux  kernel  where it should expect to find the I/O port
       and IRQ lines of a particular serial port.  It does  *not*
       configure  the hardware, the actual serial board, to use a
       particular I/O port.  In order to do that, you  will  need
       architecture,  normally  an  IRQ  line  may  not be shared
       between two or more serial ports.  If you  attempt  to  do
       this,  one  or both serial ports will become unreliable if
       you try to use both simultaneously.  This  limitation  can
       be  overcome  by  special  multi-port  serial port boards,
       which are designed to share multiple serial ports  over  a
       single  IRQ  line.   Multi-port  serial cards supported by
       Linux include the AST FourPort, the  Accent  Async  board,
       the   Usenet  Serial  II  board,  the  Bocaboard  BB-1004,
       BB-1008, and BB-2016 boards, and the HUB-6 serial board.

       The selection of an alternative  IRQ  line  is  difficult,
       since  most of them are already used.  The following table
       lists the "standard MS-DOS" assignments of  available  IRQ
       lines:

              IRQ 3: COM2
              IRQ 4: COM1
              IRQ 5: LPT2
              IRQ 7: LPT1

       Most  people  find  that  IRQ 5 is a good choice, assuming
       that there is only one parallel port active  in  the  com­
       puter.  Another good choice is IRQ 2 (aka IRQ 9); although
       this IRQ is sometimes used  by  network  cards,  and  very
       rarely VGA cards will be configured to use IRQ 2 as a ver­
       tical retrace interrupt.  If your VGA card  is  configured
       this  way;  try  to disable it so you can reclaim that IRQ
       line for some other card.  It's not  necessary  for  Linux
       and most other Operating systems.

       The  only  other  available IRQ lines are 3, 4, and 7, and
       these are probably used by the other serial  and  parallel
       ports.  (If your serial card has a 16bit card edge connec­
       tor, and supports higher interrupt numbers, then  IRQ  10,
       11, 12, and 15 are also available.)

       On  AT  class  machines, IRQ 2 is seen as IRQ 9, and Linux
       will interpret it in this manner.

       IRQ's other than 2 (9), 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11,  12,  and  15,
       should <I>not</I> be used, since they are assigned to other hard­
       ware and cannot, in general, be  changed.   Here  are  the
       "standard" assignments:

              IRQ  0      Timer channel 0
              IRQ  1      Keyboard
              IRQ  2      Cascade for controller 2
              IRQ  3      Serial port 2
              IRQ  4      Serial port 1
              IRQ  5      Parallel port 2 (Reserved in PS/2)
              IRQ  6      Floppy diskette

       or  not  there are any pending ports which need to be ser­
       viced.  If your multiport board supports these ports,  you
       should  make use of them to avoid potential lockups if the
       interrupt gets lost.

       In order to set these ports  specify  <B>set_multiport</B>  as  a
       parameter,  and  follow  it with the multiport parameters.
       The multiport parameters take the form of  specifying  the
       <I>port</I>  that  should be checked, a <I>mask</I> which indicate which
       bits in the register are significant, and finally, a <I>match</I>
       parameter  which  specifies  what  the significant bits in
       that register must match when there  is  no  more  pending
       work to be done.

       Up to four such port/mask/match combinations may be speci­
       fied.  The first such combinations should be specified  by
       setting the parameters <B>port1</B>, <B>mask1</B>, and <B>match1</B>.  The sec­
       ond such  combination  should  be  specified  with  <B>port2</B>,
       <B>mask2</B>,  and  <B>match2</B>,  and so on.  In order to disable this
       multiport checking, set <B>port1</B> to be zero.

       In order to view the current multiport  settings,  specify
       the parameter <B>get_multiport</B> on the command line.

       Here  are  some  multiport settings for some common serial
       boards:

              AST FourPort    port1 0x1BF mask1 0xf match1 0xf

              Boca BB-1004/8  port1 0x107 mask1 0xff match1 0

              Boca BB-2016    port1 0x107 mask1 0xff match1 0
                              port2 0x147 mask2 0xff match2 0

<H2>Hayes ESP Configuration</H2><PRE>
       <B>Setserial</B> may also be used to configure ports on  a  Hayes
       ESP serial board.

       The following parameters when configuring ESP ports:

       <B>rx_trigger</B>
              This is the trigger level (in bytes) of the receive
              FIFO. Larger values may result in fewer  interrupts
              and  hence better performance; however, a value too
              high could result in data loss. Valid values are  1
              through 1023.

       <B>tx_trigger</B>
              This  is the trigger level (in bytes) of the trans­
              mit FIFO. Larger values may result in fewer  inter­
              rupts  and  hence  better  performance;  however, a
              him to resume sending bytes) after having flowed it
              off.   Valid values are 1 through 1023.  This value
              should be less than the flow off level, but greater
              than the receive trigger level.

       <B>rx_timeout</B>
              This  is  the amount of time that the ESP port will
              wait after receiving  the  final  character  before
              signaling an interrupt.  Valid values are 0 through
              255.  A value too high will increase latency, and a
              value too low will cause unnecessary interrupts.
