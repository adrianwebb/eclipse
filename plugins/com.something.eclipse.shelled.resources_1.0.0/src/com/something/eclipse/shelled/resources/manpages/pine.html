<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Pine  is  a screen-oriented message-handling tool.  In its
       default configuration, Pine offers an  intentionally  lim­
       ited  set  of functions geared toward the novice user, but
       it also has a growing list of  optional  "power-user"  and
       personal-preference  features.  <I>pinef</I> is a variant of Pine
       that uses function keys rather than mnemonic single-letter
       commands.  Pine's basic feature set includes:

              View,  Save,  Export, Delete, Print, Reply and For­
              ward messages.

              Compose messages in a  simple  editor  (Pico)  with
              word-wrap  and a spelling checker.  Messages may be
              postponed for later completion.

              Full-screen selection  and  management  of  message
              folders.

              Address  book to keep a list of long or frequently-
              used addresses.  Personal distribution lists may be
              defined.   Addresses  may be taken into the address
              book from incoming mail without retyping them.

              New mail checking and notification occurs automati­
              cally every 2.5 minutes and after certain commands,
              e.g. refresh-screen (Ctrl-L).

              On-line, context-sensitive help screens.

       Pine supports  MIME  (Multipurpose  Internet  Mail  Exten­
       sions),  an  Internet  Standard for representing multipart
       and multimedia data in email.  Pine  allows  you  to  save
       MIME  objects to files, and in some cases, can also initi­
       ate the correct program for viewing the object.   It  uses
       the  system's <I>mailcap</I> configuration file to determine what
       program can process a particular MIME object type.  Pine's
       message  composer  does not have integral multimedia capa­
       bility, but any type of data file --including multimedia--
       can  be  attached  to a text message and sent using MIME's
       encoding rules.  This allows any group of individuals with
       MIME-capable  mail  software  (e.g. Pine, PC-Pine, or many
       other programs) to exchange formatted  documents,  spread-
       sheets, image files, etc, via Internet email.

       Pine  uses  the <I>c-client</I> messaging API to access local and
       remote mail folders. This library provides  a  variety  of
                           composer.

       <B>-attach</B> <I>file</I>        Send mail with the listed <I>file</I>  as  an
                           attachment.

       <B>-attachlist</B> <I>file-list</I>
                           Send mail with the listed <I>file-list</I> as
                           an attachments.

       <B>-attach_and_delete</B> <I>file</I>
                           Send mail with the listed <I>file</I>  as  an
                           attachment,  and remove the file after
                           the message is sent.

       <B>-aux</B> <I>local</I><B>_</B><I>directory</I>
                           PC-Pine only. When using a remote con­
                           figuration  (-p  &lt;remote_config&gt;) this
                           tells PC-Pine the local  directory  to
                           use  for storing auxiliary files, like
                           debug files, address books, and signa­
                           ture files.

       <B>-bail</B>               Exit  if  the  pinerc  file  does  not
                           exist. This might  be  useful  if  the
                           config  file  is  accessed  using some
                           remote  filesystem  protocol.  If  the
                           remote  mount  is  missing  this  will
                           cause Pine to quit instead of creating
                           a new pinerc.

       <B>-c</B> <I>context-number</I>   context-number  is  the  number corre­
                           sponding to the  folder-collection  to
                           which  the  <I>-f</I>  command  line argument
                           should be applied.  By default the  <I>-f</I>
                           argument   is  applied  to  the  first
                           defined folder-collection.

       <B>-conf</B>               Produce a  sample/fresh  copy  of  the
                           system-wide     configuration    file,
                           <I>pine.conf,</I>  on  the  standard  output.
                           This  is  distinct  from  the per-user
                           <I>.pinerc</I> file.

       <B>-convert_sigs</B> <I>-p</I> <I>pinerc</I>
                           Convert signature files  into  literal
                           signatures.

       <B>-copy_abook</B> <B>&lt;</B><I>local</I><B>_</B><I>abook</I>&gt; &lt;<I>remote</I><B>_</B><I>abook</I>&gt;
                           Copy  the local address book file to a
                           remote address book folder.

       <B>-copy_pinerc</B> <B>&lt;</B><I>local</I><B>_</B><I>pinerc</I>&gt; &lt;<I>remote</I><B>_</B><I>pinerc</I>&gt;
                           address  book  file.  The mtime of the
                           address book  file  at  the  time  the
                           index  file was built is stored inside
                           the  index  file  and   a   comparison
                           between that stored value and the cur­
                           rent mtime of the address book file is
                           done  when somebody runs pine.  If the
                           mtime has changed since the index file
                           was  made,  then  pine  will  want  to
                           rebuild  the  index  file.   In  other
                           words, don't build the index file with
                           this option and then copy the  address
                           book to its final destination in a way
                           which changes the file's mtime.

                           For  PC-Pine only, this option affects
                           the values of Pine's registry entries.
                           Possible   values  for  <I>cmd</I>  are  set,
                           clear,  and  dump.   <I>Set</I>  will  always
                           reset  Pine's registry entries accord­
                           ing to its  current  settings.   <I>Clear</I>
                           will  clear the registry values.  <I>Dump</I>
                           will display  the  values  of  current
                           registry settings.  Note that the dump
                           command is currently disabled.   With­
                           out the -registry option, PC-Pine will
                           write values into the registry only if
                           there currently aren't any values set.

       <B>-r</B>                  Use restricted/demo mode.   <I>Pine</I>  will
                           only send mail to itself and functions
                           like save and export are restricted.

       <B>-sort</B> <I>order</I>         Sort the FOLDER INDEX display  in  one
                           of   the  following  orders:  <I>arrival,</I>
                           <I>date,</I>  <I>subject,</I>  <I>orderedsubj,</I>  <I>thread,</I>
                           <I>from,</I> <I>size,</I> <I>score,</I> <I>to,</I> <I>cc,</I> or <I>reverse.</I>
                           <I>Arrival</I> order  is  the  default.   The
                           OrderedSubj    choice    simulates   a
                           threaded  sort.   Any  sort   may   be
                           reversed  by  adding  <I>/reverse</I>  to it.
                           <I>Reverse</I>  by  itself  is  the  same  as
                           <I>arrival/reverse</I>.

       <B>-supported</B>          Some  options  may  or may not be sup­
                           ported depending on how Pine was  com­
                           piled.   This  is  a  way to determine
                           which options  are  supported  in  the
                           particular copy of Pine you are using.

                           <I>fig.</I>  Exceptions are used to  override
                           your  default  pinerc  settings  for a
                           particular platform, can  be  a  local
                           file or a remote folder.

       dence:

        o built-in defaults.
        o system-wide <I>pine.conf</I> file.
        o   personal  <I>.pinerc</I>  file  (may  be  set  via  built-in
       Setup/Config menu.)
        o command-line options.
        o system-wide <I>pine.conf.fixed</I> file.

       There is one exception to the rule that configuration val­
       ues  are  replaced  by  the  value of the same option in a
       higher-precedence file: the feature-list variable has val­
       ues  that  are  additive, but can be negated by prepending
       "no-" in front of an individual feature  name.  Unix  Pine
       also uses the following environment variables:

         TERM
         DISPLAY       (determines  if  Pine  can  display  IMAGE
       attachments.)
         SHELL       (if not set, default is /bin/sh )
         MAILCAPS    (semicolon delimited list of path  names  to
       mailcap files)
