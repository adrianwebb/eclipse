       <B>isdnconf</B>



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>isdnconf</I> can manipulate or read  the  file  <I>/etc/isdn/cal­</I>
       <I>lerid.conf</I>  as  well  as <I>~/.isdn</I>.  Entries can be added or
       removed from these files.  Additionally,  entries  can  be
       searched  for  and displayed in a way similar to <B>grep</B>.  An
       entry can be an own MSN (<B>[MSN]</B>) or a phone  number  (<B>[NUM­</B>
       <B>BER]</B>).

       You  can  use  this  program  to build your own phonebook.
       These files are used by many of the other  ISDN  utilities
       that  use  phone  numbers,  to display a number symbolicly
       instead of as a plain number.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       Note: usage of the options -A and  -D  is  dangerous!  The
       complete  structure  of  the  file may be changed, and all
       comments are removed! Make  backups  of  your  data  files
       before trying these.

       <B>COMMAND</B> <B>OPTIONS:</B>


       <B>-A</B>  Add  a  new  entry, which is read from standard input.
           The following values are asked for  (here  with  exam­
           ples):

           Alias:          Fred
           Number:         0815/441777
           SI:             0
           Zone:           4
           Interface:      -
           Flags:          I|O
           Program:        /usr/local/bin/ring
           User:           uucp
           Group:          user
           Interval:
           Time:           8-20
           Flags:          (control-D here indicates end of flags)

           Alias:          (control-D here indicated end of entries)

           If  you  want  another [Flags] entry, simply enter the
           data for another program for this number at the  point
           where the control-D was given above.

           cussed below (see <B>DATA</B> <B>OPTIONS</B>).


       <B>-V</B>  version:  display the program's version and terminate.



       If both -A and -D are given together, <I>isdnconf</I> will termi­
       nate, as this is not a valid combination.

       If  neither -A nor -D is given, then <I>isdnconf</I> will display
       entries which match the data given.

       <B>DATA</B> <B>OPTIONS:</B> (none applicable for -A)

       <B>-n</B> <B>'number'</B>
           number: match the given number. It can  contain  wild­
           cards.


       <B>-a</B> <B>'alias'</B>
           alias:  match  the given alias name. The name can con­
           tain wildcards.  Note: due to a bug, use  '?'  instead
           of '-'.


       <B>-t</B> <B>'SI'</B>
           SI: match the given service indicator.


       <B>-c</B> <B>'code'</B>
           code:  match  the  area code of the phone number. Only
           usable for displaying (not for -A nor -D).


       <B>-i</B>  ignore case for the -n and -a options.


       <B>-w</B>  word: the parameters for -n  and  -a  must  match  the
           <B>whole</B> value, not just a substring.
           Examples (here for -n):

           "*34*" matches 123456, 345677, 1234
           "34*"  matches 34567, 34111 but not 1234
           "34??" matches 3411, 3456
           "34"   matches only 34

           Without the -w option, these would match:

           "*34*" matches 123456, 345677, 1234
           "34*"  matches 123456, 345677, 1234, 34567, 34111
           "34??" matches 123456, 345677, 1234, 3411, 3456

       <B>-q</B>  quiet: when using the -A or -D commands, the output is
           suppressed.   When  not  using  the -A or -D commands,
           only the alias of the matching  number  is  shown,  or
           just the number in case the alias is not found.


       <B>-m</B>  MSN:  when  used  in  combination with the -A command,
           instructs <B>isdnconf</B> to create  a  new  MSN  entry;  the
           default is to create a new NUMBER entry. Only the val­
           ues alias, number, SI, zone and interface are applica­
           ble to an MSN entry.


       The  following  two  options do not apply to the -A and -D
       commands. They only change the output format.


       <B>-s</B>  short: only display the alias and the number.


       <B>-l</B>  long: also display the programs to run (<B>[START]</B>).


       <B>-f</B> <B>'filename'</B>
           file:  usually  <B>isdnconf</B>   uses   the   <I>/etc/isdn/cal­</I>
           <I>lerid.conf</I>  and  the <I>~/.isdn</I> files. If <B>isdnconf</B> should
           be applied to another file, use this option.


       <B>-g</B>  global: only  applies  to  the  -A  and  -D  commands.
           Instead of editing <I>~/.isdn</I>, <I>/etc/isdn/callerid.conf</I> is
           edited.


       <B>-1</B>  first: only delete or display the first entry.


       <B>-M</B>  isdnmon: used internally by isdnmon to get alias info.
