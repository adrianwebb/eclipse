<H2>Note of warning</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation, and may  not  be  entirely
       accurate  or  complete.   See the end of this man page for
       details.

<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       The mtype command is used to display contents of an MS-DOS
       file. Its syntax is:

       mtype [-ts] <I>msdosfile</I> [ <I>msdosfiles</I>... ]


       Mtype displays the specified MS-DOS file on the screen.

       In addition to the standard options, Mtype allows the fol­
       lowing command line options:

       t      Text file viewing.  Mtype translates incoming  car­
              riage return/line feeds to line feeds.

       s      Mtype strips the high bit from the data.

       The  mcd  command  may be used to establish the device and
       the current working directory (relative to MS-DOS), other­
       wise the default is A:/.

       Mtype  returns  0  on success, 1 on utter failure, or 2 on
       partial failure.

       Unlike the MS-DOS version of TYPE, mtype  allows  multiple
       arguments.

<H2>Viewing the texi doc</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this  process  is
       only  approximative,  and  some items, such as crossrefer­
       ences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  translation
       process.   Indeed,  these items have no appropriate repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I strongly advise you to use  the  original  texinfo  doc.
       See  the  end of this manpage for instructions how to view
       the texinfo doc.


       *      To  generate  an  info copy (browsable using emacs'
              info mode), run:

                     <B>./configure;</B> <B>make</B> <B>info</B>



       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.
       Indeed, in the info version certain examples are difficult
       to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
