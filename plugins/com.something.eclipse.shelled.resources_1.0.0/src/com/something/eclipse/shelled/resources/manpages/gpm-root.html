<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>gpm-root</B> [ <I>options</I> ]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The program gpm-root is designed to  handle  Control-Mouse
       events to draw menus on the background of the current tty.
       The actual menus are described by a configuration file  in
       the user's home directory.


       Please  note  that gpm-root needs to run with Linux 1.1.73
       or newer, because previous kernels lack some  screen  han­
       dling capabilities required by the program.


       The  program  uses the files /dev/vcs* to draw to the con­
       sole screen.  These are available only from kernel  1.1.81
       onward.  If you miss those device nodes, you should create
       them using create_vcs in the distribution  directory.  The
       tool  won't  run  with  kernels older than 1.1.81, because
       they lacked a full screen dump/restore capability.


       Available command line options are the following:

       -m <B>number</B>
              Choose the modifier to use (by  default:  control).
              The  modifier can be provided either as a number or
              as a symbolic string.  Allowed strings  are  shift,
              anyAlt, leftAlt, rightAlt, control.

       -u     Deny  using user-specific configuration files. With
              this option on,  only  /etc/gpm/root.conf  will  be
              used as a source of configuration information. This
              option is intended for those system  administrators
              who  fear  security could be broken by this daemon.
              Things should be sufficiently secure,  but  if  you
              find a hole please tell me about it.

       -D     Do  not  automatically  enter  background operation
              when started, and  log  messages  to  the  standard
              error  stream,  not  the syslog mechanism.  This is
              useful for debugging; in previous releases  it  was
              done with a compile-time option.

       -V <B>verbosity</B> <B>increment</B>
              Raise  the  maximum  level of messages that will be
              logged.  Thus a positive argument has the effect of
              making the program more verbose.  One can also give
              a negative argument to hush the  program;  however,
              note  that  due to <B>getopt(3)</B> rules a negative argu­

       The syntax for the file won't be described here, being  it
       quite apparent from the example above. Blanks and newlines
       are unused in parsing the file, and the layout of the file
       is  free.  Comments are allowed in the file: any hash mark
       (#) found at the beginning of  the  line  or  after  white
       space  makes  the  parser  discard anything up to the next
       line. To insert quotes (") in strings precede them with  a
       backslash.


       Note  that  recursive  menus  are allowed, to any level of
       recursion.


       Keywords belong to three groups: the button  keyword,  the
       cfg  keywords  and  the  action  keywords.  They  are  all
       described in the table below:

       button <B>number</B> <B>menu</B>
              The button keyword is used to introduce a menu.  It
              is  followed  by  the number of the relevant button
              (1=left, 2=middle, 3=right), an open brace, a  menu
              and  a  closed  brace.   A  menu  is made up of cfg
              statements,  followed  by  action  statements.  Cfg
              statements  can  come in any order, while the order
              of action statements  tells  the  actual  order  in
              which  actions  will  appear  on the screen, top to
              bottom.


       The following statements belong to the cfg set.

       name <B>string</B>
              If the  name  keyword  is  present,  the  specified
              <B>string</B>  will  be  used  as the name for the current
              menu.

       background <B>color</B>
              This statements is used to specify  the  background
              color to be used in the current menu. The <B>color</B> can
              be  specified  with  one  of  the  eight  canonical
              strings   black,  red,  cyan  etc.  The  background
              defaults to black.

       foreground <B>color</B>
              This statements is used to specify  the  foreground
              color  for menu items. Its value defaults to white.
              An optional bright keyword can  appear  before  the
              actual color.

       border <B>color</B>
              When  the mouse button is released above the corre­
              sponding menu item, the <B>cmdstring</B> is pasted in  the
              keyboard  queue of the current console. This is not
              yet implemented.

       <B>string</B> f.bgcmd <B>cmdstring</B>
              When the mouse button is released above the  corre­
              sponding  menu item, a shell (/bin/sh) is forked to
              execute the specified command, with stdin connected
              to  /dev/null,  and stdout, stderr connected to the
              active console.

       <B>string</B> f.jptty <B>ttynumber</B>
              When the mouse button is released above the  corre­
              sponding  menu item, the console is switched to the
              one specified. The <B>ttynumber</B> must be specified as a
              string. Any tty can be reached this way, even those
              which are not accessible via the keyboard.

       <B>string</B> f.mktty <B>ttynumber</B>
              When the mouse button is released above the  corre­
              sponding  menu item, an unused console is selected,
              and /sbin/mingetty is executed in it.  The  current
              console  is switched to the newly opened console. I
              use this command to save kernel memory by opening a
              single  console through /etc/inittab and requesting
              the others only when i need to login.

       <B>string</B> <B>Whole-menu</B>
              A menu can directly follow the label string.   When
              the  mouse  pointer  leaves  the  menu frame at the
              level of <B>string</B>, a second menu is posted on screen.

       <B>string</B> f.lock
              When  the mouse button is released above the corre­
              sponding menu item, the keyboard and the screen are
              locked,  and only the locking user or the superuser
              can unlock them. This is not yet implemented.

       <B>string</B> f.load
              The current loadavg when the menu is posted is con­
              catenated  to  <B>string</B>  to  build the actual message
              displayed on  screen.  Nothing  happens  at  button
              release.

       <B>string</B> f.free
              The free memory and swap when the menu is posted is
              concatenated to <B>string</B> to build the actual  message
              displayed  on  screen.  Nothing  happens  at button
              release.

       <B>string</B> f.time
       <B>string</B> f.nop
              This  does  nothing, it only displays <B>string</B> on the
              menu.


       The HOME, LOGNAME and USER environment variables are setup
       to  the  values  for  the invoking user before spawning an
       external process (f.bgcmd, f.pipe). The current  directory
       is always /.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       Known  bugs  have been fixed. In particular, if you invoke
       gpm-root right after gpm, it  will  delay  a  few  seconds
       before trying to connect to the daemon.
