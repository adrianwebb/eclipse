<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter  (shell)  usable  as  an
       interactive login shell and as a shell script command pro­
       cessor.  Of the standard shells, zsh most  closely  resem­
       bles  <B>ksh</B> but includes many enhancements.  Zsh has command
       line editing, builtin  spelling  correction,  programmable
       command  completion, shell functions (with autoloading), a
       history mechanism, and a host of other features.

<H2>AUTHOR</H2><PRE>
       Zsh was originally written by Paul  Falstad  <B>&lt;pf@zsh.org&gt;</B>.
       Zsh  is  now  maintained by the members of the zsh-workers
       mailing list <B>&lt;zsh-workers@sunsite.dk&gt;</B>.  The development is
       currently  coordinated  by Peter Stephenson <B>&lt;pws@zsh.org&gt;</B>.
       The coordinator can be contacted at <B>&lt;coordinator@zsh.org&gt;</B>,
       but  matters  relating  to the code should generally go to
       the mailing list.


</PRE>
<H2>AVAILABILITY</H2><PRE>
       Zsh is available from the following anonymous  FTP  sites.
       These  mirror  sites  are kept frequently up to date.  The
       sites marked with  <I>(H)</I>  may  be  mirroring  <B>ftp.cs.elte.hu</B>
       instead of the primary site.

<H2>THE ZSH WEB PAGE</H2><PRE>
       Zsh   has   a   web   page    which    is    located    at
       <B>http://www.zsh.org/</B>.  This is maintained by Karsten Thyge­
       sen <B>&lt;karthy@zsh.org&gt;</B>, of  SunSITE  Denmark.   The  contact
       address for web-related matters is <B>&lt;webmaster@zsh.org&gt;</B>.


</PRE>
<H2>THE ZSH USERGUIDE</H2><PRE>
       A  userguide  is currently in preparation.  It is intended
       to complement the manual, with explanations and  hints  on
       issues  where the manual can be cabbalistic, hierographic,
       or downright mystifying (for  example,  the  word  `hiero­
       graphic' does not exist).  It can be viewed in its current
       state at <B>http://zsh.sunsite.dk/Guide/</B>.   At  the  time  of
       writing,  chapters  dealing  with  startup files and their
       contents and the new completion  system  were  essentially
       complete.


</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The  following  flags  are  interpreted  by the shell when
       invoked to determine where the shell  will  read  commands
       from:

       <B>-c</B>     Take  the  first  argument as a command to execute,
              rather than reading commands from a script or stan­
              dard  input.   If  any further arguments are given,
              the first one is assigned to <B>$0</B>, rather than  being
              used as a positional parameter.

       <B>-i</B>     Force shell to be interactive.
       acts like a single-letter option, but  takes  a  following
       string as the option name.  For example,

              <B>zsh</B> <B>-x</B> <B>-o</B> <B>shwordsplit</B> <B>scr</B>

       runs the script <B>scr</B>, setting the <B>XTRACE</B> option by the cor­
       responding letter `<B>-x</B>' and  the  <B>SH_WORD_SPLIT</B>  option  by
       name.   Options  may  be  turned  <I>off</I>  by name by using <B>+o</B>
       instead of <B>-o</B>.  <B>-o</B> can be stacked up with  preceding  sin­
       gle-letter  options,  so  for example `<B>-xo</B> <B>shwordsplit</B>' or
       `<B>-xoshwordsplit</B>' is equivalent to `<B>-x</B> <B>-o</B> <B>shwordsplit</B>'.

       Options may also be specified by name in GNU  long  option
       style, `<B>--</B><I>option-name</I>'.  When this is done, `<B>-</B>' characters
       in the option name are permitted: they are translated into
       `<B>_</B>',   and   thus   ignored.    So,   for   example,  `<B>zsh</B>
       <B>--sh-word-split</B>' invokes zsh with the <B>SH_WORD_SPLIT</B> option
       turned  on.   Like  other  option syntaxes, options can be
       turned off by replacing the initial `<B>-</B>' with a  `<B>+</B>';  thus
       `<B>+-sh-word-split</B>'  is  equivalent to `<B>--no-sh-word-split</B>'.
       Unlike other option syntaxes, GNU-style long options  can­
       not  be  stacked  with  any  other options, so for example
       `<B>-x-shwordsplit</B>' is an error, rather  than  being  treated
       like `<B>-x</B> <B>--shwordsplit</B>'.

       The  special  GNU-style  option `<B>--version</B>' is handled; it
       sends to standard output the shell's version  information,
       then  exits  successfully.   `<B>--help</B>'  is also handled; it
       sends to standard output a list of  options  that  can  be
       used when invoking the shell, then exits successfully.

       Option  processing  may  be  finished,  allowing following
       arguments that start with `<B>-</B>' or `<B>+</B>' to be treated as nor­
       mal  arguments, in two ways.  Firstly, a lone `<B>-</B>' (or `<B>+</B>')
       as an argument by itself  ends  option  processing.   Sec­
       ondly, a special option `<B>--</B>' (or `<B>+-</B>'), which may be spec­
       ified on its own (which is the standard  POSIX  usage)  or
       may be stacked with preceding options (so `<B>-x-</B>' is equiva­
       lent to `<B>-x</B> <B>--</B>').  Options are not permitted to be stacked
       after `<B>--</B>' (so `<B>-x-f</B>' is an error), but note the GNU-style
       option form discussed above, where `<B>--shwordsplit</B>' is per­
       mitted and does not end option processing.

       Except when the <B>sh</B>/<B>ksh</B> emulation single-letter options are
       in effect, the option `<B>-b</B>' (or `<B>+b</B>') ends option  process­
       ing.  `<B>-b</B>' is like `<B>--</B>', except that further single-letter
       options can be stacked after the `<B>-b</B>' and will take effect
       as normal.




</PRE>
<H2>COMPATIBILITY</H2><PRE>
       <B>PROMPT4</B>, <B>psvar</B>, <B>status</B>, <B>watch</B>.

       The  usual  zsh startup/shutdown scripts are not executed.
       Login shells source <B>/etc/profile</B> followed  by  <B>$HOME/.pro­</B>
       <B>file</B>.   If  the <B>ENV</B> environment variable is set on invoca­
       tion, <B>$ENV</B> is sourced  after  the  profile  scripts.   The
       value  of <B>ENV</B> is subjected to parameter expansion, command
       substitution, and arithmetic expansion before being inter­
       preted  as  a  pathname.   Note that the <B>PRIVILEGED</B> option
       also affects the execution of startup files.

       The following options are set if the shell is  invoked  as
       <B>sh</B>   or  <B>ksh</B>:  <B>NO_BAD_PATTERN</B>,  <B>NO_BANG_HIST</B>,  <B>NO_BG_NICE</B>,
       <B>NO_EQUALS</B>,        <B>NO_FUNCTION_ARGZERO</B>,         <B>GLOB_SUBST</B>,
       <B>NO_GLOBAL_EXPORT</B>,       <B>NO_HUP</B>,      <B>INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS</B>,
       <B>KSH_ARRAYS</B>,     <B>NO_MULTIOS</B>,     <B>NO_NOMATCH</B>,     <B>NO_NOTIFY</B>,
       <B>POSIX_BUILTINS</B>,     <B>NO_PROMPT_PERCENT</B>,     <B>RM_STAR_SILENT</B>,
       <B>SH_FILE_EXPANSION</B>,       <B>SH_GLOB</B>,       <B>SH_OPTION_LETTERS</B>,
       <B>SH_WORD_SPLIT</B>.      Additionally    the    <B>BSD_ECHO</B>    and
       <B>IGNORE_BRACES</B> options are set if zsh  is  invoked  as  <B>sh</B>.
       Also,  the  <B>KSH_OPTION_PRINT</B>,  <B>LOCAL_OPTIONS</B>, <B>PROMPT_BANG</B>,
       <B>PROMPT_SUBST</B> and <B>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</B> options are set if zsh is
       invoked as <B>ksh</B>.


</PRE>
<H2>RESTRICTED SHELL</H2><PRE>
       When the basename of the command used to invoke zsh starts
       with the letter `<B>r</B>' or the `<B>-r</B>'  command  line  option  is
       supplied  at  invocation,  the  shell  becomes restricted.
       Emulation mode is determined after  stripping  the  letter
       `<B>r</B>'  from the invocation name.  The following are disabled
       in restricted mode:

       ·      changing directories with the <B>cd</B> builtin

       ·      changing or unsetting the <B>PATH</B>, <B>path</B>,  <B>MODULE_PATH</B>,
              <B>module_path</B>,  <B>SHELL</B>, <B>HISTFILE</B>, <B>HISTSIZE</B>, <B>GID</B>, <B>EGID</B>,
              <B>UID</B>,     <B>EUID</B>,      <B>USERNAME</B>,      <B>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</B>,
              <B>LD_AOUT_LIBRARY_PATH</B>,         <B>LD_PRELOAD</B>        and
              <B>LD_AOUT_PRELOAD</B> parameters

       ·      specifying command names containing <B>/</B>

       ·      specifying command pathnames using <B>hash</B>

       ·      redirecting output to files

       ·      using the <B>exec</B> builtin command to replace the shell
              with another command

       ·      using <B>jobs</B> <B>-Z</B> to overwrite the shell process' argu­
              ment and environment space

       restrictions described above even if the shell  still  has
       not processed all startup files.


</PRE>
<H2>STARTUP/SHUTDOWN FILES</H2><PRE>
       Commands  are  first read from <B>/etc/zshenv</B>; this cannot be
       overridden.  Subsequent behaviour is modified by  the  <B>RCS</B>
       and  <B>GLOBAL_RCS</B>  options;  the  former affects all startup
       files, while the second only affects  those  in  the  <B>/etc</B>
       directory.   If  one of the options is unset at any point,
       any subsequent startup file(s) of the  corresponding  type
       will  not  be  read.   It  is  also possible for a file in
       <B>$ZDOTDIR</B> to re-enable <B>GLOBAL_RCS</B>. Both <B>RCS</B> and  <B>GLOBAL_RCS</B>
       are set by default.

       Commands  are  then  read  from  <B>$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv</B>.  If the
       shell is a login shell, commands are read from  <B>/etc/zpro­</B>
       <B>file</B>  and  then <B>$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile</B>.  Then, if the shell is
       interactive, commands are read from  <B>/etc/zshrc</B>  and  then
       <B>$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc</B>.   Finally, if the shell is a login shell,
       <B>/etc/zlogin</B> and <B>$ZDOTDIR/.zlogin</B> are read.

       When a login shell exits, the files <B>$ZDOTDIR/.zlogout</B>  and
       then  <B>/etc/zlogout</B>  are read.  This happens with either an
       explicit exit via the  <B>exit</B>  or  <B>logout</B>  commands,  or  an
       implicit  exit  by  reading end-of-file from the terminal.
       However, if the shell terminates due to  <B>exec</B>'ing  another
       process,  the  logout  files are not read.  These are also
       affected by the <B>RCS</B> and  <B>GLOBAL_RCS</B>  options.   Note  also
       that  the  <B>RCS</B> option affects the saving of history files,
       i.e. if <B>RCS</B> is unset when the shell exits, no history file
       will be saved.

       If  <B>ZDOTDIR</B>  is  unset, <B>HOME</B> is used instead.  Those files
       listed above as being in <B>/etc</B> may be in another directory,
       depending on the installation.

       As  <B>/etc/zshenv</B>  is  run  for  all instances of zsh, it is
       important that it be kept as small as possible.   In  par­
       ticular,  it is a good idea to put code that does not need
       to be run for every single shell behind a test of the form
       `<B>if</B>  <B>[[</B>  <B>-o</B>  <B>rcs</B> <B>]];</B> <B>then</B> <B>...</B>' so that it will not be exe­
       cuted when zsh is invoked with the `<B>-f</B>' option.

       Any of these files may be pre-compiled with  the  <B>zcompile</B>
       builtin  command (see <B>zshbuiltins(1)</B>).  If a compiled file
       exists (named for the original file plus the  <B>.zwc</B>  exten­
       sion) and it is newer than the original file, the compiled
       file will be used instead.
