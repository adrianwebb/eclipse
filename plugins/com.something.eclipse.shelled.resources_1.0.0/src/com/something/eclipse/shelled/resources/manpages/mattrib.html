       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation, and may  not  be  entirely
       accurate  or  complete.   See the end of this man page for

<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       Mattrib is used to change MS-DOS file attribute flags.  It
       has the following syntax:

       mattrib  [-a|+a]  [-h|+h]  [-r|+r] [-s|+s] [-/]  [-p] [-X]
       <I>msdosfile</I> [ <I>msdosfiles</I> ... ]

       Mattrib adds attribute flags to an MS-DOS file  (with  the
       `+'  operator)  or  remove  attribute  flags (with the `-'
       operator).

       Mattrib supports the following attribute bits:

       a      Archive bit.  Used by some backup programs to indi­
              cate a new file.

       r      Read-only  bit.  Used to indicate a read-only file.
              Files with this bit set cannot be erased by DEL nor
              modified.

       s      System bit.  Used by MS-DOS to indicate a operating
              system file.

       h      Hidden bit.  Used to make files hidden from DIR.

       Mattrib supports the following command line flags:

       /      Recursive.  Recursively list the attributes of  the
              files in the subdirectories.

       X      Concise. Prints the attributes whithout any whites­
              pace padding.  If neither the "/" option is  given,
              nor the <I>msdosfile</I> contains a wildcard, and there is
              only one Msdos file parameter on the command  line,
              only  the  attribute  is printed, and not the file­
              name.  This option is convenient for scripts

       p      Replay mode.  Outputs a series of mformat  commands
              that will reproduce the current situation, starting
              from a situation  as  left  by  untarring  the  Dos
              filesystem.  Commands are only output for attribute
              settings that differ from the default (archive  bit
              set for files, unset for directories).  This option

       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I  strongly  advise  you  to use the original texinfo doc.
       See the end of this manpage for instructions how  to  view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To  generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc,
              run the following commands:

                     <B>./configure;</B> <B>make</B> <B>dvi;</B> <B>dvips</B> <B>mtools.dvi</B>



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     <B>./configure;</B> <B>make</B> <B>html</B>

              A    premade    html    can    be     found     at:
              `http://mtools.linux.lu'      and      also     at:
              `http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/mtools'

       *      To generate an info copy  (browsable  using  emacs'
              info mode), run:

                     <B>./configure;</B> <B>make</B> <B>info</B>



       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.
       Indeed, in the info version certain examples are difficult
       to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
