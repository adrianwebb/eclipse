<H2>Note of warning</H2><PRE>
       This  manpage  has  been  automatically   generated   from
       mtools's  texinfo  documentation,  and may not be entirely
       accurate or complete.  See the end of this  man  page  for
       details.

<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       The  mbadblocks  command  is used to scan an MS-DOS floppy
       and mark its unused bad blocks as bad. It uses the follow­
       ing syntax:

       mbadblocks <I>drive</I>:

       Mbadblocks  scans  an  MS-DOS  floppy  for bad blocks. All
       unused bad blocks are marked as such in the FAT.  This  is
       intended  to  be  used  right  after  mformat.   It is not
       intended to salvage bad disks.


</PRE>
<H2>Bugs</H2><PRE>
       Mbadblocks should (but doesn't yet :-( ) also try to  sal­
       vage  bad  blocks which are in use by reading them repeat­
       edly, and then mark them bad.

<H2>Viewing the texi doc</H2><PRE>
       This  manpage  has  been  automatically   generated   from
       mtools's  texinfo  documentation. However, this process is
       only approximative, and some items,  such  as  crossrefer­
       ences,  footnotes and indices are lost in this translation
       process.  Indeed, these items have no  appropriate  repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I  strongly  advise  you  to use the original texinfo doc.
       See the end of this manpage for instructions how  to  view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To  generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc,
              run the following commands:

       Indeed, in the info version certain examples are difficult
       to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
