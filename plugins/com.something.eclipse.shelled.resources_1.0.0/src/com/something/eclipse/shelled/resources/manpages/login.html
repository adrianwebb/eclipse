<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>login</B> [ <B>-p</B> ] [ <I>username</I> ]
       <B>login</B> [ <B>-p</B> ] [ <B>-h</B> <I>host</I> ] [ <B>-f</B> <I>username</I> ] <I>host</I>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>login</B>  is used when signing onto a system.  If no argument
       is given, <B>login</B> prompts for the username.

       The user is then prompted for  a  password,  where  appro­
       prate.  Echoing is disabled to prevent revealing the pass­
       word. Only a small number of password failures are permit­
       ted before <B>login</B> exits and the communications link is sev­
       ered.

       If password aging has been enabled for  the  account,  the
       user may be prompted for a new password before proceeding.
       He will be forced to provide his old password and the  new
       password  before continuing. Please refer to <B>passwd(1)</B> for
       more information.

       The user and group ID will be set according to their  val­
       ues  in the file. There is one exception if the user ID is
       zero: in this case, only  the  primary  group  ID  of  the
       account  is  set.  This  should  prevent  that  the system
       adminitrator cannot login in  case  of  network  problems.
       The  value  for  <B>$HOME</B>, <B>$SHELL</B>, <B>$PATH</B>, <B>$LOGNAME</B>, and <B>$MAIL</B>
       are set according to the appropriate fields in  the  pass­
       word        entry.         <B>$PATH</B>        defaults        to
       <I>/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:.</I>  for normal users,  and  to
       <I>/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin</I>  for  root if not other con­
       figured. Ulimit, umask and nice values  may  also  be  set
       according  to  entries in the GECOS field. The environment
       variable <B>$TERM</B> will be  preserved,  if  it  exists  (other
       environment  variables  are  preserved if the <B>-p</B> option is
       given) or be initialize to the terminal type on  your  tty
       line, as specified in <I>/etc/ttytype</I>.

       Then the user's shell is started. If no shell is specified
       for the user in <B>/etc/passwd</B>, then  <B>/bin/sh</B>  is  used.   If
       there  is no directory specified in <I>/etc/passwd</I>, then <I>/</I> is
       used (the home directory is  checked  for  the  <I>.hushlogin</I>
       file described above).

       This  login  implementation  does  ignore <I>/etc/nologin</I> and
       <I>/etc/securetty</I>.  You need to configure  this  in  the  PAM
       configuration file for <B>login</B> in <I>/etc/pam.d/login</I>.

       <B>login</B>  reads  the  <I>/etc/</I><B>login.defs(5)</B>  configuration file.
       Please refer to this documenation for options which  could
       be set.

<H2>SPECIAL ACCESS RESTRICTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The  file <I>/etc/securetty</I> lists the names of the ttys where
       root is allowed to log in. One name of a tty device  with­
       out  the  /dev/ prefix must be specified on each line.  If
       the file does not exist, root is allowed to log in on  any
       tty.  You  need  to add the <B>/lib/security/pam_securetty.so</B>
       module in <I>/etc/pam.d/login</I> for activating.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       A  recursive login, as used to be possible in the good old
       days, no longer works; for most purposes <B>su(1)</B> is a satis­
       factory  substitute.  Indeed,  for security reasons, login
       does a vhangup() system call to remove any  possible  lis­
       tening  processes  on  the  tty. This is to avoid password
       sniffing. If one uses the command "login", then  the  sur­
       rounding  shell  gets  killed by vhangup() because it's no
       longer the true owner of the tty.  This can be avoided  by
       using "exec login" in a top-level shell or xterm.
