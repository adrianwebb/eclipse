<H2>Note of warning</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation, and may  not  be  entirely
       accurate  or  complete.   See the end of this man page for
       details.

<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       The mcopy command is used to copy MS-DOS files to and from
       Unix. It uses the following syntax:


          mcopy [-bspanvmQT] [-D <I>clash</I><B>_</B><I>option</I>] <I>sourcefile</I> <I>targetfile</I>
          mcopy [-bspanvmQT] [-D <I>clash</I><B>_</B><I>option</I>] <I>sourcefile</I> [ <I>sourcefiles</I>... ] <I>targetdirectory</I>
          mcopy [-tnvm] <I>MSDOSsourcefile</I>



       Mcopy  copies  the  specified  file  to the named file, or
       copies multiple files to the named directory.  The  source
       and target can be either MS-DOS or Unix files.

       The use of a drive letter designation on the MS-DOS files,
       'a:' for example, determines the direction of  the  trans­
       fer.   A  missing  drive  designation  implies a Unix file
       whose path starts in the current directory.  If  a  source
       drive letter is specified with no attached file name (e.g.
       mcopy a: .), all files are copied from that drive.

       If only a single,  MS-DOS  source  parameter  is  provided
       (e.g.  "mcopy  a:foo.exe"),  an implied destination of the
       current directory (`.') is assumed.

       A filename of `-' means standard input or standard output,
       depending on its position on the command line.

       Mcopy accepts the following command line options:

       t      Text file transfer.  Mcopy translates incoming car­
              riage return/line feeds to line feeds when  copying
              from  Dos to Unix, and vice-versa when copying from
              Unix to Dos.

       b      Batch mode. Optimized for  huge  recursive  copies,
              but less secure if a crash happens during the copy.

       s      Recursive copy.  Also copies directories and  their
              contents

       p      Preserves the attributes of the copied files
              replaced by '.'.

       n      No confirmation when overwriting Unix files.  Mcopy
              doesn't warn the user when overwriting an  existing
              Unix file.  In order to switch off confirmation for
              DOS files, use -o.

       m      Preserve the file modification time. If the  target
              file  already  exists,  and the -n option is not in
              effect, mcopy asks whether to overwrite the file or
              to   rename  the  new  file  (`name  clashes')  for
              details).

       v      Verbose. Displays the name of each file  as  it  is
              copied.

<H2>Bugs</H2><PRE>
       Unlike  MS-DOS,  the  '+' operator (append) from MS-DOS is
       not supported. However, you may use mtype to  produce  the
       same effect:

          <B>mtype</B> <B>a:file1</B> <B>a:file2</B> <B>a:file3</B> <B>&gt;unixfile</B>
          <B>mtype</B> <B>a:file1</B> <B>a:file2</B> <B>a:file3</B> <B>|</B> <B>mcopy</B> <B>-</B> <B>a:msdosfile</B>

<H2>Viewing the texi doc</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this  process  is
       only  approximative,  and  some items, such as crossrefer­
       ences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  translation
       process.   Indeed,  these items have no appropriate repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I strongly advise you to use  the  original  texinfo  doc.
       See  the  end of this manpage for instructions how to view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo  doc,
              run the following commands:

                     <B>./configure;</B> <B>make</B> <B>dvi;</B> <B>dvips</B> <B>mtools.dvi</B>



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

       Indeed, in the info version certain examples are difficult
       to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
