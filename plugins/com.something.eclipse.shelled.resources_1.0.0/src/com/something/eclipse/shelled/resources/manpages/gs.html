<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <B>gs</B> (<B>gswin32</B>, <B>gswin32c</B>, <B>gs386</B>, <B>gsos2</B>)  command  invokes
       <B>Ghostscript</B>,    an    interpreter    of   Adobe   Systems'
       <B>PostScript</B>(tm) and <B>Portable</B>  <B>Document</B>  <B>Format</B>  (PDF)  lan­
       guages.  <B>gs</B> reads "files" in sequence and executes them as
       Ghostscript programs.  After doing this, it reads  further
       input  from  the  standard input stream (normally the key­
       board), interpreting each  line  separately.   The  inter­
       preter quits gracefully when it encounters the "quit" com­
       mand (either in a file or from the keyboard),  at  end-of-
       file,  or at an interrupt signal (such as Control-C at the
       keyboard).

       The  interpreter  recognizes  several  switches  described
       below,  which  may appear anywhere in the command line and
       apply to all files thereafter.  Invoking Ghostscript  with
       the <B>-h</B> or <B>-?</B> switch produces a message which shows several
       useful switches, all the devices known to that executable,
       and  the  search path for fonts; on Unix it also shows the
       location of detailed documentation.

       Ghostscript may be built able to use many different output
       devices.   To  see  which devices your executable can use,
       run "<B>gs</B> <B>-h</B>".  Unless  you  specify  a  particular  device,
       Ghostscript  normally  opens  the  first  one of those and
       directs output to it, so if the first one in the  list  is
       the one you want to use, just issue the command

            gs myfile.ps

       You  can  also  check  the  set  of available devices from
       within Ghostscript: invoke Ghostscript and type

            devicenames ==

       but the first device on the resulting list may not be  the
       default  device  you  determine  with "<B>gs</B> <B>-h</B>".  To specify
       "AbcXyz" as the initial output device, include the switch

            -sDEVICE=AbcXyz

       For example, for output to an Epson printer you might  use
       the command

       or
            (x11) selectdevice

       Finally,  you can specify a default device in the environ­
       ment variable <B>GS_DEVICE</B>.   The  order  of  precedence  for
       these  alternatives  from  highest  to lowest (Ghostscript
       uses the device defined highest in the list) is:

            selectdevice
            (command line)
            GS_DEVICE
            (first device in build list)

       Some printers can print at different  resolutions  (densi­
       ties).   To  specify the resolution on such a printer, use
       the "-r" switch:

            gs -sDEVICE=&lt;device&gt; -r&lt;xres&gt;x&lt;yres&gt;

       For example, on a 9-pin Epson-compatible printer, you  get
       the lowest-density (fastest) mode with

            gs -sDEVICE=epson -r60x72

       and the highest-density (best output quality) mode with

            gs -sDEVICE=epson -r240x72.

       If  you select a printer as the output device, Ghostscript
       also allows you to choose where Ghostscript sends the out­
       put  --  on Unix systems, usually to a temporary file.  To
       send the output to a file "foo.xyz", use the switch

            -sOutputFile=foo.xyz

       You might want to print each page separately.  To do this,
       send  the output to a series of files "foo1.xyz, foo2.xyz,
       ..." using the "-sOutputFile=" switch with "%d" in a file­
       name template:

            -sOutputFile=foo%d.xyz

       Each  resulting  file receives one page of output, and the
       files are numbered in sequence.  "%d" is a  printf  format
       specification; you can also use a variant like "%02d".

       On  Unix  systems you can also send output to a pipe.  For
       example, to pipe output to the "<B>lpr</B>"  command  (which,  on
       many  Unix  systems,  directs  it  to  a printer), use the
       switch

            -sOutputFile=\|lpr

       for instance

            -sPAPERSIZE=a4
       or
            -sPAPERSIZE=legal

       At  this  time, the known paper sizes, defined in the ini­
       tialization file "gs_statd.ps", are:

       PAPERSIZE    X inches   Y inches   X cm      Y cm

       Ghostscript  can  do  many things other than print or view
       PostScript and PDF files.  For example,  if  you  want  to
       know  the  bounding  box  of  a  PostScript (or EPS) file,
       Ghostscript provides a special "device" that  just  prints
       out this information:

                 gs -sDEVICE=bbox myfile.ps

       tor, Ghostscript first tries to open  the  file  with  the
       name  as  given, using the current working directory if no
       directory is specified.  If this fails, and the file  name
       doesn't  specify  an  explicit  directory  or  drive  (for
       instance, doesn't contain "/" on Unix systems  or  "\"  on
       DOS systems), Ghostscript tries directories in this order:

       1.  the directories specified by the <B>-I</B>  switches  in  the
           command line (see below), if any;

       2.  the  directories  specified  by the <B>GS_LIB</B> environment
           variable, if any;

       3.  the directories specified by the <B>GS_LIB_DEFAULT</B>  macro
           in  the  Ghostscript  makefile when the executable was
           built.  When <B>gs</B> is built on  Unix,  <B>GS_LIB_DEFAULT</B>  is
           usually
           "/usr/share/ghostscript/#.##:/usr/share/ghostscript/fonts"
           where  "#.##"  represents the Ghostscript version num­
           ber.

       Each of these (<B>GS_LIB_DEFAULT</B>, <B>GS_LIB</B>, and  <B>-I</B>  parameter)
       may  be either a single directory or a list of directories
       separated by ":".


</PRE>
<H2>X RESOURCES</H2><PRE>
       Ghostscript looks for the following  resources  under  the
       program name "Ghostscript":

       <B>borderWidth</B>
              The border width in pixels (default = 1).

       <B>borderColor</B>
              The name of the border color (default = black).

       <B>geometry</B>
              The  window size and placement, WxH+X+Y (default is
              NULL).

       <B>xResolution</B>
              The number of x pixels per inch  (default  is  com­
              puted from <B>WidthOfScreen</B> and <B>WidthMMOfScreen</B>).

       <B>yResolution</B>
              The  number  of  y pixels per inch (default is com­
              puted from <B>HeightOfScreen</B> and <B>HeightMMOfScreen</B>).

       <B>useBackingPixmap</B>
              Determines whether backing store is to be used  for
              saving display window (default = true).

       See  the  usage  document  for  a  more  complete  list of
              Takes the next argument as a file  name  as  usual,
              but  takes  all  remaining  arguments (even if they
              have the syntactic form of  switches)  and  defines
              the  name  "ARGUMENTS"  in "userdict" (not "system­
              dict") as an array of those strings, <B>before</B> running
              the  file.  When Ghostscript finishes executing the
              file, it exits back to the shell.

       <B>-D</B><I>name</I><B>=</B><I>token</I>
       <B>-d</B><I>name</I><B>=</B><I>token</I>
              Define a name in "systemdict" with the given  defi­
              nition.   The  token  must be exactly one token (as
              defined by the "token" operator) and may contain no
              whitespace.

       <B>-D</B><I>name</I>
       <B>-d</B><I>name</I> Define a name in "systemdict" with value=null.

       <B>-S</B><I>name</I><B>=</B><I>string</I>
       <B>-s</B><I>name</I><B>=</B><I>string</I>
              Define  a  name in "systemdict" with a given string
              as value.  This is different from <B>-d</B>.  For example,
              <B>-dname=35</B> is equivalent to the program fragment
                        /name 35 def
              whereas <B>-sname=35</B> is equivalent to
                        /name (35) def

       <B>-q</B>     Quiet  startup:  suppress  normal startup messages,
              and also do the equivalent of <B>-dQUIET</B>.

       <B>-g</B><I>number1</I><B>x</B><I>number2</I>
              Equivalent to <B>-dDEVICEWIDTH=</B><I>number1</I>  and  <B>-dDEVICE­</B>
              <B>HEIGHT=</B><I>number2</I>.  This is for the benefit of devices
              (such as X11 windows) that require (or allow) width
              and height to be specified.

       <B>-r</B><I>number</I>
       <B>-r</B><I>number1</I><B>x</B><I>number2</I>
              Equivalent to <B>-dDEVICEXRESOLUTION=</B><I>number1</I> and <B>-dDE­</B>
              <B>VICEYRESOLUTION=</B><I>number2</I>.  This is for  the  benefit
              of devices such as printers that support multiple X
              and Y resolutions.  If only one number is given, it
              is used for both X and Y resolutions.

       <B>-I</B><I>directories</I>
              Adds the designated list of directories at the head
              of the search path for library files.

       <B>-</B>      This is not  really  a  switch,  but  indicates  to
              Ghostscript  that  standard  input is coming from a
              file or a pipe and not interactively from the  com­
              mand  line.   Ghostscript reads from standard input
              Disables the "deletefile" and  "renamefile"  opera­
              tors  and  the  ability  to  open files in any mode
              other than read-only. This is desirable for  spool­
              ers  or any other environments where a malicious or
              badly written PostScript program must be  prevented
              from changing important files.

       <B>-dBATCH</B>
              Causes  Ghostscript  to  exit  after processing all
              files  named  on  the  command  line,  rather  than
              prompting for further PostScript commands.

       <B>-dNOPAUSE</B>
              Disables  the  prompt  and pause at the end of each
              page. This may be desirable in converting documents
              or  for applications where another program is driv­
              ing Ghostscript.

       <B>-sDEVICE=</B><I>device</I>
              Selects an  alternate  initial  output  device,  as
              described above.

       <B>-sOutputFile=</B><I>filename</I>
              Selects  an alternate output file (or pipe) for the
              initial output device, as described above.

       <B>-dNODISPLAY</B>
              Suppresses the normal initialization of the  output
              device.  This may be useful when debugging.

       <B>-dNOCACHE</B>
              Disables  character caching. Useful only for debug­
              ging.

       <B>-dNOBIND</B>
              Disables  the  "bind"  operator.  Useful  only  for
              debugging.

       <B>-dNOPLATFONTS</B>
              Disables  the use of fonts supplied by the underly­
              ing platform (for instance X Windows). This may  be
              needed  if the platform fonts look undesirably dif­
              ferent from the scalable fonts.

       <B>-dDISKFONTS</B>
              Causes individual character outlines to  be  loaded
              from  the disk the first time they are encountered.
              (Normally Ghostscript loads all the character  out­
              lines when it loads a font.) This may allow loading
              more fonts into RAM, at the expense of slower  ren­
              dering.
