<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       ksymoops  extracts  kernel Oops reports from the Oops.file
       and uses various sources of symbol information to  convert
       the  addresses  and  code to meaningful text.  Reporting a
       kernel Oops is meaningless on its own because other people
       do  not know what your kernel looks like, you need to feed
       the Oops text through  ksymoops  then  send  the  ksymoops
       output as part of your bug report.

       The  ksymoops  executable  is meant to be run whenever you
       have Oops to report.  The original Oops text can come from
       anywhere.   Typically  it  is  in  a  file created by your
       <B>syslogd(8)</B>.  If syslogd is not available, the log might be
       available  via  <B>dmesg(8)</B>.   If  you  are  running a serial
       console (see linux/Documentation/serial-console.txt)  then
       you  can capture the Oops text on another machine.  If all
       else fails, copy the Oops by hand from the screen,  reboot
       and enter it by hand.

       ksymoops  can be run by anybody who has read access to the
       various input files.  It does not have to be run as  root.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       Some  of  the  options have default values that are set in
       the Makefile.   The  text  below  describes  the  standard
       defaults  but  your distribution may have been modified to
       use different defaults.  If  in  doubt,  <I>ksymoops</I> <I>-h</I>  will
       list the current defaults.
       <B>-m</B> <I>system.map</I> or  <B>-M</B>  are  specified,  ksymoops  prints  a
       warning message.

           You  did not tell me where to find symbol information.
           I will assume that the  log  matches  the  kernel  and
           modules  that  are  running right now and I'll use the
           default options above for symbol resolution.   If  the
           current  kernel  and/or  modules do not match the log,
           you can get more accurate output  by  telling  me  the
           kernel  version  and where to find map, modules, ksyms
           etc.  ksymoops -h explains the options.

       If any of the <B>-v</B> <I>vmlinux</I>, <B>-k</B> <I>ksyms</I>, <B>-l</B> <I>lsmod</I>, <B>-o</B> <I>object</I> or
       <B>-m</B> <I>system.map</I>  options  contain the string *r (*m, *n, *s)
       then the string is replaced at run  time  by  the  current
       value of `uname -r` (-m, -n, -s).  This is mainly intended
       to let ksymoops automatically pick  up  version  dependent
       files  using  its  default parameters, however it could be
       used by bug reporting scripts  to  automatically  pick  up
       files  whose  name  or  directory  depends  on the current
       kernel.

       <B>-v</B> <I>vmlinux</I> <B>--vmlinux=</B><I>vmlinux</I>
              Name of the vmlinux file that  corresponds  to  the
              failing  kernel.   <B>Note:</B> This  is the vmlinux file,
              not zImage, bzImage, vmlinuz etc.   Typically  this
              would  be  /usr/src/linux/vmlinux.   If you specify
              <B>-v</B>, you should only specify it once.

       <B>-V</B> <B>--no-vmlinux</B>
              Do not read any vmlinux file.

       Default is <B>-V</B>.

       <B>-k</B> <I>ksyms</I> <B>--ksyms=</B><I>ksyms</I>
              Where to find the list of  kernel  symbols  at  the
              time  of  the  failure.   Unfortunately  the kernel
              symbol list  in  /proc/ksyms  is  volatile,  it  is
              updated  as modules are loaded and removed.  Try to
              copy /proc/ksyms  to  a  normal  file  as  soon  as
              possible  after the Oops and point ksymoops at that
              copy  using   <B>-k</B>.    Modutils   has   support   for
              automatically  copying  ksyms  and  lsmod data, see
              <B>insmod(8)</B>.  If you had to reboot after the Oops and
              you  do  not have a copy of /proc/ksyms at the time
              of the Oops, try to reload the same modules in  the
              same order before running ksymoops.  If you specify
              <B>-k</B>, you should only specify it once.

       <B>-K</B> <B>--no-ksyms</B>
              Do not read any kernel symbols.

              running  ksymoops.   If  you specify <B>-l</B>, you should
              only specify it once.

       <B>-L</B> <B>--no-lsmod</B>
              Do not read any list of loaded modules.

       Default is <B>-l</B> <I>/proc/modules</I>.

       <B>-o</B> <I>object</I> <B>--object=</B><I>object</I>
              Where to find the objects for modules used  by  the
              failing kernel.  This can be a directory name or an
              individual  file.   If  it  is  a  directory   then
              ksymoops does a recursive <B>find(1)</B> in that directory
              for all files matching '*.o'.  <B>-o</B> can be  specified
              more  than  once,  the  list  is cumulative and can
              contain a mixture of directories and files.

              <B>Note:</B> When you specify a directory,  ksymoops  only
              uses files that end in '.o'.  Any modules with non-
              standard names are ignored unless you specify those
              files  explicitly.  For example, if vmnet and vmmon
              modules do not end in '.o', you need something like
              this  to  pick  up  all the normal modules plus the
              non-standard names.

                <B>-o</B> <I>/lib/modules/*r/</I> <B>\</B>
                <B>-o</B> <I>/lib/modules/*r/misc/vmnet</I> <B>\</B>
                <B>-o</B> <I>/lib/modules/*r/misc/vmmon</I>

              If you are using a version of <B>insmod(8)</B> that stores
              the module filename in /proc/ksyms, ksymoops can go
              directly to that file, it does not need <B>-o</B>.  The <B>-o</B>
              option  is  only  used when ksyms contains at least
              one module whose filename is not explicitly  listed
              in ksyms.

       <B>-O</B> <B>--no-object</B>
              Do  not  scan  for  any objects.  If /proc/ksyms is
              supplied and insmod added the  ksymoops  assistance
              symbols (starting with __insmod) then those symbols
              are  used  to  access  the  objects,  no  directory
              scanning  is  done  so  neither  -o nor -O have any
              effect.  To completely disable the  use  of  module
              objects   when  ksyms  contains  __insmod  symbols,
              specify -O <B>and</B> one of -i or -I.

       Default is <B>-o</B> <I>/lib/modules/*r/</I>.  For example, if  uname -r
       reports  2.2.7,  ksymoops uses <B>-o</B> <I>/lib/modules/2.2.7/</I>, but
       only if it does not already know where the objects are.

       <B>-m</B> <I>system.map</I> <B>--system-map=</B><I>system.map</I>
              Where to find the System.map corresponding  to  the
              not  need to save the map for normal bug reporting.

       Default is no saved map.

       <B>-S</B> <B>--short-lines</B>
              Some of the ksymoops  output  lines  can  be  quite
              long,  especially  in  the code disassembly, but if
              you have a  wide  screen  the  ksymoops  output  is
              easier  to  read  as  long  lines.   The  <B>-S</B> toggle
              switches between short and long lines.   Note  that
              lines  printed by the kernel and extracted from the
              Oops.file are not affected by <B>-S</B>, problem  text  is
              printed as is.

       Default is short lines.

       <B>-e</B> <B>--endian-swap</B>
              ksymoops  extracts  code bytes from the reports and
              converts them to instructions.  All  kernels  print
              code  bytes  in  hex but unfortunately some systems
              print  multiple  bytes  using  the  native  machine
              endianess.   This only causes a problem if the code
              is printed in anything other than  1  byte  chunks.
              For  example,  i386 prints one byte at a time which
              is machine portable, alpha prints 4 bytes at a time
              in  native  endianess and the report is not machine
              portable.

              If you are doing cross system Oops  diagnosis  (say
              for  a new system or an embedded version of Linux),
              then the failing system and  the  reporting  system
              can  have  different  endianess.   On  systems that
              support little and big endianess at the same  time,
              ksymoops  could  be compiled with one endianess but
              the kernel dump could be using  another.   If  your
              code  disassembly  is  wrong,  specify  <B>-e</B>.  The <B>-e</B>
              toggles between native and reverse  endianess  when
              reading  the  bytes in each chunk of code.  In this
              context, a chunk of code is 4 or 8 hex digits (2 or
              4  bytes of code), <B>-e</B> has no effect on code that is
              printed as 2 hex digits (one byte at a time).

              <B>Note:</B>  Earlier  versions   of   ksymoops   used   a
              <B>-c</B> <I>code</I><B>_</B><I>bytes</I> option.  That is now obsolete, use <B>-e</B>
              instead, but only  when  the  code  disassembly  is
              incorrect.

       The default is to read code bytes using the endianess that
       ksymoops was compiled with.

       <B>-x</B> <B>--hex</B>
              Normally, ksymoops prints offsets  and  lengths  in
                  while (true)
                  do
                   ksymoops -1 &gt; $HOME/oops1
                   if [ $? -eq 3 ]
                   then
                      exit 0  # end of input, no Oops found
                   fi
                   mail -s Oops admin &lt; $HOME/oops1
                  done

                  tail -f /var/log/messages | ksymoops1

              Restarting the tail command after log  rotation  is
              left as an exercise for the reader.

              In  one  shot  mode,  reading of the various symbol
              sources is delayed until ksymoops  sees  the  first
              program  counter,  call  trace  or code line.  This
              ensures that  the  current  module  information  is
              used.   The  downside  is that any parameter errors
              are not detected until an Oops actually occurs.

       The default is to  read  everything  from  the  Oops.file,
       extracting  and processing every Oops it finds.  Note that
       the default method  reads  the  symbol  sources  once  and
       assumes that the environment does not change from one Oops
       to the next, not necessarily  valid  when  you  are  using
       modules.

       <B>-i</B> <B>--ignore-insmod-path</B>
              When  you are using an initial ramdisk for modules,
              the path name to  the  modules  is  typically  just
              /lib.    That   pathname   is   recorded   in   the
              __insmod..._O symbol in ksyms but  ksymoops  cannot
              find  the  files  in  the  real  /lib, so it issues
              warning messages.  If you specify -i then  ksymoops
              ignores  the  path  name  in  __insmod...O symbols,
              instead it searchs the -o paths  (if  any)  looking
              for  the  object  with  the  correct  basename  and
              timestamp.  -i is recommended when loading  modules
              from  a  ramdisk.   This  assumes that the -o paths
              contain the modules used to build the ramdisk, with
              the same timestamp.

       Default is to use the path from __insmod...O symbols.

       <B>-T</B> <B>--ignore-insmod-all</B>
              Use  this  toggle  if you want to completely ignore
              all  <B>insmod(8)</B>  assistance   information   (symbols
              starting  with  __insmod  in ksyms).  This includes
              module paths, timestamps, section start and  length
              etc.   Then  ksymoops  will  fall  back  on the old
              should have the same address to appear at different
              addresses.   This  is  a  particular  problem  when
              building  for  mixed  32  and  64  bit targets.  To
              remove the ambiguity, use  <B>--truncate=</B><I>truncate</I>.   A
              value  of  0  means  no truncation, a value greater
              than 8*sizeof(unsigned long) is silently  converted
              to 0.

       Default is <B>--truncate=</B><I>0</I>, no truncation.

       <B>-d</B> <B>--debug</B>
              Each occurrence of <B>-d</B> increases the debugging level
              of ksymoops by one.

       Level 1
              Regular expression compile summaries.   Before  and
              after    text   for   *[mns]   expansion.    Option
              processing, but only for  options  appearing  after
              <B>-d</B>.    Entry   to  the  main  processing  routines.
              KSYMOOPS_  environment  variables.   Object   files
              extracted  directly  from  ksyms.   Information  on
              matches between loaded modules and module  objects.
              Filename  of  the  Oops report.  Version number for
              the oops.  Saving merged system map.

       Level 2
              Summary information on symbol table  sizes.   Every
              version number found in the oops.  Comparing symbol
              maps.  Appending symbol maps.  Full pathname  of  a
              program.    External   commands  issued.   Progress
              reports for <B>-o</B> <I>object</I>.  The names  of  '*.o'  files
              found  in  a  <B>-o</B> directory.  Offset adjustments for
              module sections.  Every line  output  from  running
              objdump on the code bytes.

       Level 3
              Every input line from Oops.file.  Non-duplicate and
              low address symbols dropped from the merged  system
              map.  Mapping of addresses to symbols.

       Level 4
              Every  input  line  from  all  sources, this prints
              duplicate  lines.   The  return  code  from   every
              regexec  call.  Ambiguous matches that are ignored.
              Every symbol added to every table.  Copying  symbol
              tables.  Increases in symbol table sizes.  Entry to
              some lower level routines.  Every symbol dropped.

       Level 5
              For matching regexecs, details on every  substring.

       Default is no debugging.
              can find out which targets your machine supports by

                ksymoops -t '?'

       Default  is  the  same target as ksymoops itself, with one
       exception.  On sparc64, the kernel  uses  elf64-sparc  but
       user  programs  are  elf32-sparc.   If  <B>-t</B> <I>target</I>  was not
       specified and ksymoops was compiled  for  elf32-sparc  and
       the  Oops  contains a TPC line then ksymoops automatically
       switches to -t elf64-sparc.

       <B>-a</B> <I>architecture</I> <B>--architecture=</B><I>architecture</I>
              To do cross system Oops processing, you  must  tell
              ksymoops  what  the  target  architecture is, using
              <B>-a</B> <I>architecture</I>,  where  <I>architecture</I>  is   a   bfd
              architecture   name.    You   can  find  out  which
              architectures your machine supports by

                ksymoops -a '?'

       Default is the same architecture as ksymoops itself,  with
       one  exception.  On sparc64, the kernel uses sparc:v9a but
       user programs  are  sparc.   If  <B>-a</B> <I>architecture</I>  was  not
       specified and ksymoops was compiled for sparc and the Oops
       contains a TPC line then ksymoops  automatically  switches
       to -a sparcv:9a.

       <B>-A</B> <I>"address</I> <I>list"</I> <B>--addresses=</B><I>"address</I> <I>list"</I> If you
              have  a  few adhoc addresses to convert to symbols,
              you can specify them explicitly  using  <B>-A</B> <I>"address</I>
              <I>list"</I>.   Any  words  in  the list that appear to be
              addresses are converted  to  symbols.   Punctuation
              characters   and  non-address  words  are  silently
              ignored, leading 0x on addresses is  also  ignored,
              so  you can paste text including words and only the
              addresses will be processed.

       <B>Oops.file</B> <B>...</B>
              ksymoops accepts zero or more input files and reads
              them all.  If no files are specified on the command
              line and no addresses  are  supplied  via  <B>-A</B>  then
              ksymoops  reads  from standard input.  You can even
              type  the  Oops  text  directly  at  the  terminal,
              although that is not recommended.


</PRE>
<H2>INPUT</H2><PRE>
       ksymoops   reads   the   input   file(s),   using  regular
       expressions to select lines that are  to  be  printed  and
       further  analyzed.   You  do  not need to extract the Oops
       report by hand.

       All tabs are  converted  to  spaces,  assuming  tabstop=8.
       Every kernel architecture team uses different messages for
       kernel problems, see Oops_read in  oops.c  for  the  full,
       gory  list.  If you are entering an Oops by hand, you need
       to follow the kernel format as much as possible, otherwise
       ksymoops  may not recognize your input.  Input is not case
       sensitive.

       A bracketed address is  optional  '[',  required  '&lt;',  at
       least  4  hex digits, required '&gt;', optional ']', optional
       spaces.  For example [&lt;01234567&gt;] or &lt;beaf&gt;.

       An unbracketed address is at least 4 hex digits,  followed
       by optional spaces.  For example 01234567 or abCDeF.

       The  sparc  PC line is 'PSR:' at start of line, space, hex
       digits, space, ´PC:', space, unbracketed address.

       The sparc64 TPC line is 'TSTATE:' at start of line, space,
       16 hex digits, space 'TPC:', space, unbracketed address.

       The   ppc  NIP  line  has  several  formats.   'kernel pc'
       'trap at PC:'  ´bad area pc'  or  'NIP:'.   Any  of  those
       strings  followed  by  a  single  space and an unbracketed
       address is the NIP value.

       The mips PC line is  'epc'  at  start  of  line,  optional
       space,  one  or  more  ´:',  optional  space,  unbracketed
       address.

       The ix86 EIP line is 'EIP:' at start of line, at least one
       space, any text, bracketed address.

       The  x86_64  EIP line is 'RIP:' at start of line, at least
       one space, any text, bracketed address.

       The m68k PC line  is  'PC'  at  start  of  line,  optional
       spaces, '=', optional spaces, bracketed address.

       The arm PC line is 'pc' at start of line, optional spaces,
       ':', optional spaces, bracketed address.

       The IA64 IP line is ' ip', optional space,  ':',  optional
       space, bracketed address.

       A  mips ra line is 'ra', optional spaces, one or more '=',
       optional spaces, unbracketed address.

       A sparc register dump line  is  ('i',  '0'  or  '4',  ':',
       space) or ('Instruction DUMP:', space) or ('Caller[').

       The  IA64  b0  line is 'b0', optional space, ':', optional
       space, unbracketed address.   This  can  be  repeated  for
       'Function entered at'  (arm  only)  or  ´Caller[' (sparc64
       only) followed by at least one space.

       For 'Trace:' and 'Call Trace:', the rest of  the  line  is
       bracketed  addresses,  they  can  be  continued onto extra
       lines.  Addresses can not be split across lines.

       For 'Call Backtrace:' (ppc only), the rest of the line  is
       unbracketed  addresses,  they  can be continued onto extra
       lines.  Addresses can not be split across lines.

       For 'Function entered at' (arm only),  the  line  contains
       exactly two bracketed addresses and is not continued.

       For  'Caller['  (sparc64  only), the line contains exactly
       one unbracketed address and is not continued.

       Spin loop information is indicated by a line starting with
       'bh: ',  followed  by  lines  containing reverse bracketed
       trace back addresses.  For some  reason,  these  addresses
       are  different from every other address and look like this
       '&lt;[hex]&gt; &lt;[hex]&gt;' instead of the normal ´[&lt;hex&gt;] [&lt;hex&gt;]'.

       The  Code  line  is  identified  by  'Instruction DUMP' or
       ('Code' followed by optional spaces),  ':',  one  or  more
       spaces,  followed by at least one hex value.  The line can
       contain multiple hex values, each separated  by  at  least
       one  space.  Each hex value must be 2 to 8 digits and must
       be a multiple of 2 digits.

       Any of the code values can be enclosed in  &lt;..&gt;  or  (..),
       the   last  such  value  is  assumed  to  be  the  failing
       instruction.  If no value has &lt;..&gt; or (..) then the  first
       byte is assumed to be the failing instruction.

       Special cases where Code: can be followed by text.  'Code:
       general protection' or 'Code: &lt;n&gt;'.  Dump the data anyway,
       the code was unavailable.

       Do you detect a slight note of inconsistency in the above?


</PRE>
<H2>ADDRESS TO SYMBOL CONVERSION</H2><PRE>
       Addresses are converted to symbols based on the symbols in
       vmlinux,   /proc/ksyms,   object  files  for  modules  and
       System.map, or as many of those sources  as  ksymoops  was
       told to read.  ksymoops uses as many symbol sources as you
       can provide, does cross checks between the various sources
       to  identify  any  discrepancies  and  builds a merged map
       containing all symbols,  including  loaded  modules  where
       possible.

       Symbols  which  end  in  _R_xxxxxxxx  (8  hex  digits)  or
       of them in /proc/ksyms so they are effectively  invisible.
       Even  when  a  module  exports  symbols, it typically only
       exports one or two, not the complete list that  is  really
       needed  for Oops diagnosis.  ksymoops can build a complete
       symbol table from the object module but it has to

       (a) Know that the module is loaded.

       (b) Find the correct object file for that module.

       (c) Convert section and symbol data from the  module  into
           kernel addresses.

       If  a  module  exports no symbols then there is no way for
       ksymoops to obtain  any  information  about  that  module.
       lsmod  says  it  is  loaded  but without symbols, ksymoops
       cannot find the corresponding object file nor map  offsets
       to  addresses.   Sorry  but  that is the way it is, if you
       Oops in a module that displays no symbols in ksyms, forget
       it :(.

       When  a  module  exports symbols, the next step is to find
       the object file for that module.  In most cases the loaded
       module  and the object file has the same basename but that
       is not guaranteed.  For example,
         insmod uart401 -o xyz
       will load uart401.o from your module directories but store
       it  as  xyz.   Both  ksyms and lsmod say module name 'xyz'
       with no indication  that  the  original  object  file  was
       uart401.  So ksymoops cannot just use the module name from
       ksyms or lsmod, it has to do a lot more work to  find  the
       correct  object.   It  does  this  by looking for a unique
       match between exported symbols and symbols in  the  module
       objects.

       For  every  file  obtained from the <B>-o</B> option(s), ksymoops
       extracts all symbols (both  static  and  external),  using
       <B>nm(1)</B>.   It then runs the exported module symbols in ksyms
       and, for every exported module symbol, it  does  a  string
       compare  of  that  symbol  against  every  symbol in every
       object.  When ksymoops  finds  a  module  symbol  that  is
       exported in ksyms and appears exactly <B>once</B> amongst all the
       <B>-o</B> objects then it has to assume that the  object  is  the
       one  used to load the module.  If ksymoops cannot find any
       match for any exported symbol in a module  or  finds  more
       than  one match for every exported symbol in a module then
       it cannot determine which object was actually loaded.

       After ksymoops has matched  a  loaded  module  against  an
       object  using  a  unique symbol, it still has to calculate
       addresses for the symbols from the object.   To  do  this,
       ksymoops  first  needs the start address of the text, data
       symbol sources contain a kernel version  number,  ksymoops
       compares  all  the version numbers.  It flags a warning if
       there is any mismatch.  One of the more common  causes  of
       problems  is force loading a module from one kernel into a
       different kernel.  Even if it was deliberate, it needs  to
       be highlighted for diagnosis.

       When  both  ksyms  and  lsmod  are  available, the list of
       modules extracted from ksyms is compared against the  list
       of  modules  from  lsmod.   Any difference is flagged as a
       warning,  it  typically   indicates   invisible   modules.
       However  it can also be caused by a mismatch between ksyms
       and lsmod.

       When multiple symbol sources are available, ksymoops  does
       cross  checks  between them.  Each check is only performed
       if both symbol sources are present and  non-empty.   Every
       symbol  in  the  first  source should appear in the second
       source and should have the same address.  Where  there  is
       any  discrepancy, one of the sources takes precedence, the
       precedence is somewhat arbitrary.  Some discrepancies  are
       silently  ignored  because  they are special cases but the
       vast majority of symbols are expected to match.

       * Exported module symbols in ksyms  are  compared  against
         the  symbols  in  the  corresponding object file.  ksyms
         takes precedence.

       * The kernel (non module) symbols from ksyms are  compared
         against vmlinux.  vmlinux takes precedence.

       * The   symbols   from  System.map  are  compared  against
         vmlinux.  vmlinux takes precedence.

       * The  symbols   from   vmlinux   are   compared   against
         System.map.    vmlinux   takes  precedence.   These  two
         sources are compared in both directions, they should  be
         identical.

       * The  kernel (non module) symbols from ksyms are compared
         against System.map.  System.map takes precedence.

       After reading and cross checking all the  symbol  sources,
       they  are  merged  into  a  single  system map.  Duplicate
       symbols, registers (type a)  and  static  'gcc2_compiled.'
       symbols are dropped from the merged map.  Any symbols with
       an address below 4096 are  discarded,  these  are  symbols
       like Using_Versions which has an address of 0.

       Given  all  the  above  processing  and  deduction,  it is
       obvious  that  the  merged  system  map  cannot  be   100%
       reliable,  which  means  that  conversion  of addresses to
       details.   If  you  want  automatic snapshots of ksyms and
       lsmod data as modules  are  loaded  and  unloaded,  create
       /var/log/ksymoops,  it  should  be owned by root with mode
       644 or 600.  If you do not want  automatic  snapshots,  do
       not      create      the      directory.      A     script
       (insmod_ksymoops_clean) is provided by modutils to  delete
       old versions, this should be run by cron once a day.


</PRE>
<H2>OUTPUT</H2><PRE>
       ksymoops  prints  all  lines that contain text which might
       indicate a kernel  problem.   Due  the  complete  lack  of
       standards  in  kernel  error  messages, I cannot guarantee
       that all problem lines are printed.  If you see a line  in
       your  logs  which  ksymoops  should  extract but does not,
       contact the maintainer.

       When ksymoops sees EIP/PC/NIP/TPC lines, call trace  lines
       or  code  lines,  it prints them and stores them for later
       processing.  When the  code  line  is  detected,  ksymoops
       converts  the  EIP/PC/NIP/TPC  address  and the call trace
       addresses to symbols.  These  lines  have  ';'  after  the
       header  instead of ':', just in case anybody wants to feed
       ksymoops output back into ksymoops, these generated  lines
       are ignored.

       Formatted  data for the program counter, trace and code is
       only output when the Code: line is seen.  If any data  has
       been  stored  for  later  formatting and more than 5 lines
       other than Oops text or end of file are  encountered  then
       ksymoops assumes that the Code: line is missing or garbled
       and dumps the formatted data anyway.  That should be  fail
       safe  because  the  Code: line (or its equivalent) signals
       the end of the Oops report.  Except  for  sparc64  on  SMP
       which  has a register dump <I>after</I> the code.  ksymoops tries
       to cater for this exception.  Sigh.

       Addresses are converted to symbols wherever possible.  For
       example

         &gt;&gt;EIP; c0113f8c &lt;sys_init_module+49c/4d0&gt;
         Trace; c011d3f5 &lt;sys_mremap+295/370&gt;
         Trace; c011af5f &lt;do_generic_file_read+5bf/5f0&gt;
         Trace; c011afe9 &lt;file_read_actor+59/60&gt;
         Trace; c011d2bc &lt;sys_mremap+15c/370&gt;
         Trace; c010e80f &lt;do_sigaltstack+ff/1a0&gt;
         Trace; c0107c39 &lt;overflow+9/c&gt;
         Trace; c0107b30 &lt;tracesys+1c/23&gt;
         Trace; 00001000 Before first symbol

       Each  converted  address is followed by the nearest symbol
       below that address.  That symbol is followed by the offset
       of  the  address  from the symbol.  The value after '/' is
       the target hardware, it defaults to EIP.

       When  a  Code:  line  is  read, ksymoops extracts the code
       bytes.  It uses the program counter line together with the
       code  bytes  to generate a small object file in the target
       architecture.   ksymoops  then   invokes   <B>objdump(1)</B>   to
       disassemble   this   object   file.   The  human  readable
       instructions are extracted from  the  objdump  output  and
       printed   with  address  to  symbol  conversion.   If  the
       disassembled code does not look sensible, see the  <I>-e</I>,  <I>-a</I>
       and <I>-t</I> options.

       <B>TAKE</B>  <B>ALL</B>  <B>SYMBOLS,</B>  <B>OFFSETS</B>  <B>AND</B>  <B>LENGTHS</B> <B>WITH</B> <B>A</B> <B>PINCH</B> <B>OF</B>
       <B>SALT!</B>  The addresses are valid but the  symbol  conversion
       is  only  as good as the input you gave ksymoops.  See all
       the problems in  "ADDRESS  TO  SYMBOL  CONVERSION"  above.
       Also the stack trace is potentially ambiguous.  The kernel
       prints any addresses on the  stack  that  <B>might</B>  be  valid
       addresses.   The  kernel  has  no way of telling which (if
       any) of these addresses are real and which are just  lying
       on  the  stack  from  previous  procedures.  ksymoops just
       decodes what the kernel prints.

</PRE>
<H2>CROSS SYSTEM OOPS DIAGNOSIS</H2><PRE>
       To process an Oops from one system on  another,  you  need
       access  to  all  the  symbol  sources,  including modules,
       System.map, ksyms etc.  If the two systems  are  different
       hardware,  you  also  need  versions of the nm and objdump
       commands that run on your system  but  handle  the  target
       system.  You also need versions of libbfd, libopcodes, and
       libiberty that handle  the  target  system.   Consult  the
       binutils  documentation  for  instructions on how to build
       cross system versions of these utilities.

       To override the default versions of nm and find,  use  the
       environment variables above.  To use different versions of
       libbfd and libiberty, use the --rpath option when  linking
       ksymoops  or the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable when
       running  ksymoops.   See  the  info  pages  for   ld   and
       /usr/doc/glibc*/FAQ.   You  can  also  build  a version of
           an Oops.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       Because  of  the  plethora  of  possible  kernel error and
       information strings, ksymoops's pattern matching sometimes
       prints  lines  that are not errors at all.  For example, a
       line starting with 3c589 matches the pattern  for  a  call
       trace line, both start with at least 4 hex digits.  Humans
       are smarter than programs, ignore spurious lines.

       &lt;schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de&gt;.   That  version
       required C++ and supported only ix86 and m68k.

       To get the equivalent of the old ksymoops.cc (no  vmlinux,
       no  modules, no ksyms, no System.map) use ksymoops -VKLOM.
       Or to just read System.map, ksymoops -VKLO -m mapfile.
