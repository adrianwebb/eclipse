<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       fillup  -  merges  input  files  into one resulting output
       file. Usually, each file is a configuration file.

       fillup merges files which are holding variables  (ie  con­
       figuration  or  environment  variables).   A  variable  is
       defined by an entity composed of a  preceding  comment,  a
       variable  name,  an  assignment  delimiter,  and a related
       variable value.  A variable is determined by its  variable
       name.

       A  preceding comment is optional.  An assignment delimiter
       may be optional, but if there is an assignment  delimiter,
       a  variable  name must precede it.  The last entity may be
       composed only of a comment.

       Only if variables are included in both input files  (base­
       file  and  addfile)  fillup has to select one of the vari­
       ables.  Otherwise, if variables are included only  in  one
       of  the input files they are added to the resulting output
       file  (with  the  exception  of  the  -i|--ignoreDefinites
       option).

       The  functionality  is now controlled by a parameter which
       determines whether a variable included both in  the  base­
       file  and  in the addfile is taken from the former or from
       the latter.  Furthermore, a parameter controls whether the
       variable is removed from a copy of the basefile.

       To  keep  the  fillup  v1.04 functionality, the outputfile
       parameter can be omitted -- this means the resulting  out­
       put  file  is named exactly like the first input file name
       (basefile = outputfile).

       If variables should be  removed  from  the  basefile,  the
       basefile  is  not  touched,  but  the result is written to
       basefile.new.

       If basefile includes a header as part of the  first  vari­
       able  this  header is preserved only for the outputfile if
       after the header an empty line follows.

       Starting  with  version  1.20  handling  of  metadata  for

       fillup -exchange "/etc/rc.config" "my.config"

       Only variables  of  "/etc/rc.config"  that  are  not  also
       defined  within  "my.config"  are  passed to the resulting
       output file "/etc/rc.config".  All variables  of  "my.con­
       fig" are appended.


       fillup -m -r "/etc/rc.config" "my.config" "/etc/rc.config"

       All  variables  of  "/etc/rc.config"  are  passed  to  the
       resulting output file "/etc/rc.config".  Variables defined
       only within  "my.config"  are  appended.   The  additional
       parameter  '-r'  removes  variables defined more than once
       from a copy of "/etc/rc.config".   "/etc/rc.config"  isn't
       touched  and  the  result  of  the  removal  is written to
       "/etc/rc.config.new".


       fillup -i "/etc/rc.config" "my.config"

       This is a filter functionality. Variables of "/etc/rc.con­
       fig"   are  only  passed  to  the  resulting  output  file
       "/etc/rc.config" if they are defined in both input  files.
       Because  "my.config"  is  normally only a list of variable
       names from "/etc/rc.config", this is  named  filter  func­
       tionality.   Additionally  variables  of  "my.config"  are
       appended if they are defined only in "my.config".

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       There are many options, which are displayed if  fillup  is
       called without or with the -h or --help option.

       Most  of  the parameters are based on v1.04. In the sequel
       only useful parameters are listed:

         -i, --ignoreDefinites    filter functionality
         -t, --trailing           save trailing comment
         -v, --verbose            maximum output to screen
         -V, --version            print fillup version and exit
         -c | --char &lt;char&gt;       use &lt;char&gt; as comment marker
         -d | --delim &lt;char&gt;      use &lt;char&gt; as delimiter

         -m, --maintain           maintaining the basefile
         -x, --exchange           exchanging the basefile
         -r, --remove             removing within a copy

<H2>EXIT CODE</H2><PRE>
       fillup  returns  EXIT_SUCCESS  on  successful  completion.
       Otherwise,  an  exception  handler  is  called,  which may
       return EXIT_FAILURE;
