<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>perlivp</B> [<B>-p</B>] [<B>-v</B>] [<B>-h</B>]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <B>perlivp</B> program is set up at Perl source code build
       time to test the Perl version it was built under.  It can
       be used after running:

           make install

       (or your platform's equivalent procedure) to verify that
       <B>perl</B> and its libraries have been installed correctly.  A
       correct installation is verified by output that looks
       like:

           ok 1
           ok 2

       etc.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-h</B> help
            Prints out a brief help message.

       <B>-p</B> print preface
            Gives a description of each test prior to performing
            it.

       <B>-v</B> verbose
            Gives more detailed information about each test,
            after it has been performed.  Note that any failed
            tests ought to print out some extra information
            whether or not -v is thrown.

<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
       · print "# Perl binary `$perlpath' does not appear exe­
       cutable.\n";
           Likely to occur for a perl binary that was not prop­
           erly installed.  Correct by conducting a proper
           installation.

       · print "# Perl version `$]' installed, expected $ivp_VER­
       SION.\n";
           Likely to occur for a perl that was not properly
           installed.  Correct by conducting a proper installa­
           tion.

       · print "# Perl \@INC directory `$_' does not appear to
       exist.\n";
           Likely to occur for a perl library tree that was not
           properly installed.  Correct by conducting a proper
           installation.

       · print "# Unnecessary module `bLuRfle' appears to be
       installed.\n";
           This test not coming out ok could indicate that you
           have in fact installed a bLuRfle.pm module or that the
           "eval " require \"$module_name.pm\"; "" test may give
           misleading results with your installation of perl.  If
           yours is the latter case then please let the author
           know.

       · print "# file",+($#missing == 0) ? '' : 's'," missing
       from installation:\n";
           One or more files turned up missing according to a run
           of "ExtUtils::Installed -&gt; validate()" over your
           installation.  Correct by conducting a proper instal­
           lation.

       · print "# Perl header `$_' does not appear to be properly
       installed.\n";
           Correct by running <B>h2ph</B> over your system's C header
           files.  If necessary, edit the resulting *.ph files to
           eliminate perl syntax errors.

       For further information on how to conduct a proper instal­
       lation consult the INSTALL file that comes with the perl
       source and the README file for your platform.
