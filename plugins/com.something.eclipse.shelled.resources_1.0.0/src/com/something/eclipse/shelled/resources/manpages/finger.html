     <B>finger</B> [<B>-l</B>] [<I>user@host</I> <I>...</I>]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <B>finger</B> utility displays information about local and remote system
     users.  By default, the following information is displayed about each
     user currently logged-in to the local host:

           <B>·</B>   login name
           <B>·</B>   user's full name
           <B>·</B>   associated terminal name
           <B>·</B>   idle time
           <B>·</B>   login time
           <B>·</B>   from where

     Idle time is in minutes if it is a single integer, hours and minutes if a
     `:' is present, or days if a `d' is present.  Login time is displayed as
     the day name if less than six days, else month, day, hours and minutes,
     unless more than six months ago, in which case the year is displayed
     rather than the hours and minutes.

     The names of terminals for which write permission is denied (see <B>mesg(1)</B>)
     are prepended with an asterisk (`*').  Unknown devices as well as nonex­
     istent idle and login times are displayed as single asterisks.

     The options are as follows:

     <B>-s</B>      Short format (default).  The information as described above is
             displayed in a columnar fashion.

     <B>-h</B>      If the <B>-s</B> option is also specified, the name of the remote host
             is displayed instead of the office location and office phone.

     <B>-o</B>      If the <B>-s</B> option is also specified, the office location and
             office phone is displayed instead of the name of the remote host.

     <B>-l</B>      Long format.  Produces a multi-line format displaying all of the
             information available from the <B>-s</B> option as well as the user's
             home directory, home phone number, login shell, mail status, and
             the contents of the ``<I>.plan</I>'' and ``<I>.project</I>'' files from the
             user's home directory.

             If idle time is at least a minute and less than a day, it is pre­
             sented in the form ``hh:mm''.  Idle times greater than a day are
             presented as ``d day[s]hh:mm''.

             Phone numbers specified as eleven digits are printed as
             ``+N-NNN-NNN-NNNN''.  Numbers specified as ten or seven digits
             are printed as the appropriate subset of that string.  Numbers
             specified as five digits are printed as ``xN-NNNN''.  Numbers
             specified as four digits are printed as ``xNNNN''.

             If write permission is denied to the device, the phrase
             however, matching will also be done on the users' real names,
             unless the <B>-m</B> option is supplied.  All name matching performed by
             <B>finger</B> is case insensitive.

     <B>-M</B>      Enable matching of <I>user</I> names.  This is disabled by default on
             systems running YP or with large password databases.

     If no options are specified, <B>finger</B> defaults to the <B>-l</B> style output if
     operands are provided, otherwise to the <B>-s</B> style.  Note that some fields
     may be missing, in either format, if information is not available for
     them.

     <B>finger</B> may be used to look up users on a remote machine.  The format is
     to specify a <I>user</I> as ``user@host'', or ``@host'', where the default out­
     put format for the former is the <B>-l</B> style, and the default output format
     for the latter is the <B>-s</B> style.  The <B>-l</B> option is the only option that
     may be passed to a remote machine.
