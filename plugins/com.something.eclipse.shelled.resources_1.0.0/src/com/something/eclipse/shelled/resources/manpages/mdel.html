<H2>Note of warning</H2><PRE>
       This  manpage  has  been  automatically   generated   from
       mtools's  texinfo  documentation,  and may not be entirely
       accurate or complete.  See the end of this  man  page  for
       details.

<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       The  mdel  command  is  used to delete an MS-DOS file. Its
       syntax is:

       mdel [-v] <I>msdosfile</I> [ <I>msdosfiles</I> ...  ]


       Mdel deletes files on an MS-DOS filesystem.

       Mdel asks for verification prior to removing  a  read-only
       file.

<H2>Viewing the texi doc</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this  process  is
       only  approximative,  and  some items, such as crossrefer­
       ences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  translation
       process.   Indeed,  these items have no appropriate repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I strongly advise you to use  the  original  texinfo  doc.
       See  the  end of this manpage for instructions how to view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo  doc,
              run the following commands:

       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     <B>./configure;</B> <B>make</B> <B>html</B>
