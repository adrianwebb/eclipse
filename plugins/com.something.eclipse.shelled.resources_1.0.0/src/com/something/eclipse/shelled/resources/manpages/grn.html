<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>grn</I> is a preprocessor for including  <I>gremlin</I>  pictures  in
       <I>groff</I>  input.   <I>grn</I>  writes to standard output, processing
       only input lines between two that start with <B>.GS</B> and  <B>.GE.</B>
       Those  lines must contain <I>grn</I> commands (see below).  These
       commands request a <I>gremlin</I> file, and the picture  in  that
       file  is  converted  and placed in the <I>troff</I> input stream.
       The <B>.GS</B> request may be followed by a C, L, or R to center,
       left,  or right justify the whole <I>gremlin</I> picture (default
       justification is center).  If no <I>file</I>  is  mentioned,  the
       standard  input  is  read.  At the end of the picture, the
       position on the page is the bottom of the <I>gremlin</I> picture.
       If  the  <I>grn</I>  entry  is ended with <B>.GF</B> instead of <B>.GE</B>, the
       position is left at the top of the picture.

       Please note that currently only the -me macro package  has
       support for <B>.GS</B>, <B>.GE</B>, and <B>.GF</B>.

       The following command-line options are understood:

       <B>-T</B><I>dev</I>  Prepare output for printer <I>dev</I>.  The default device
              is <B>ps</B>.  See <B>groff(1)</B> for acceptable devices.

       <B>-M</B><I>dir</I>  Prepend <I>dir</I> to the default search path for  <I>gremlin</I>
              files.   The  default  path  is (in that order) the
              current    directory,    the    home     directory,
              <B>/usr/lib/groff/site-tmac</B>,    <B>/usr/share/groff/site-</B>
              <B>tmac</B>, and <B>/usr/share/groff/1.17.2/tmac</B>.

       <B>-F</B><I>dir</I>  Search <I>dir</I> for subdirectories <B>dev</B><I>name</I> (<I>name</I> is  the
              name  of  the  device) for the <B>DESC</B> file before the
              normal <B>/usr/share/groff/1.17.2/font</B>.

       <B>-C</B>     Recognize <B>.GS</B> and <B>.GE</B> (resp.  <B>.GF</B>) even  when  fol­
              lowed by a character other than space or newline.

       <B>-v</B>     Print the version number.


</PRE>
<H2>GRN COMMANDS</H2><PRE>
       Each  input line between <B>.GS</B> and <B>.GE</B> may have one <I>grn</I> com­
       mand.  Commands consist of one or two strings separated by
       white  space,  the  first string being the command and the
       second its operand.  Commands may be upper or  lower  case
       and abbreviated down to one character.

       Commands that affect a picture's environment (those listed
       <B>special</B> <I>f</I>
              Set  the  roman (italics, bold, or special) font to
              <I>troff</I>'s font <I>f</I> (either  a  name  or  number).   The
              default is R (resp. I, B, and S).

       <B>l</B> <I>f</I>
       <B>stipple</B> <I>f</I>
              Set  the  stipple  font  to  <I>troff</I>'s stipple font <I>f</I>
              (name or  number).   The  command  <B>stipple</B>  may  be
              abbreviated down as far as `st' (to avoid confusion
              with <B>special</B>).  There is <I>no</I>  default  for  stipples
              (unless  one is set by the default command), and it
              is illegal to include a <I>gremlin</I> picture with  poly­
              gons without specifying a stipple font.

       <B>x</B> <I>N</I>
       <B>scale</B> <I>N</I>
              Magnify  the  picture  (in  addition to any default
              magnification) by <I>N</I>, a floating point number larger
              than  zero.   The  command <B>scale</B> may be abbreviated
              down to `sc'.

       <B>narrow</B> <I>N</I>
       <B>medium</B> <I>N</I>
       <B>thick</B> <I>N</I>
              Set the thickness of <I>gremlin</I>'s narrow (resp. medium
              and  thick) lines to <I>N</I> times 0.15pt (this value can
              be changed at compile time).  The  default  is  1.0
              (resp.  3.0  and  5.0), which corresponds to 0.15pt
              (resp. 0.45pt and 0.75pt).  A  thickness  value  of
              zero selects the smallest available line thickness.
              Negative values cause the line thickness to be pro­
              portional to the current point size.

       <B>pointscale</B> <I>&lt;off/on&gt;</I>
              Scale  text  to match the picture.  Gremlin text is
              usually printed in the point  size  specified  with
              the  commands <B>1</B>, <B>2</B>, <B>3</B>, or <B>4</B> regardless of any scal­
              ing factors in  the  picture.   Setting  <B>pointscale</B>
              will  cause  the point sizes to scale with the pic­
              ture (within <I>troff</I>'s limitations, of  course).   An
              operand  of anything but <I>off</I> will turn text scaling
              on.

       <B>default</B>
              Reset the picture environment defaults to the  set­
              tings  in the current picture.  This is meant to be
              used as a global parameter setting mechanism at the
              beginning  of the <I>troff</I> input file, but can be used
              at any time to reset the default settings.

       <B>width</B> <I>N</I>
              Get picture from <I>gremlin</I> file <I>name</I> located the cur­
              rent  directory  (or  in the library directory; see
              the <B>-M</B> option above).  If  two  <B>file</B>  commands  are
              given, the second one overrides the first.  If <I>name</I>
              doesn't exist, an error  message  is  reported  and
              processing continues from the <B>.GE</B> line.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES ABOUT GROFF</H2><PRE>
       Since <I>grn</I> is a preprocessor, it doesn't know about current
       indents, point  sizes,  margins,  number  registers,  etc.
       Consequently, no <I>troff</I> input can be placed between the <B>.GS</B>
       and <B>.GE</B> requests.  However, <I>gremlin</I> text is now  processed
       by  <I>troff</I>,  so  anything  legal  in a single line of <I>troff</I>
       input is legal in a line  of  <I>gremlin</I>  text  (barring  `.'
       directives  at the beginning of a line).  Thus, it is pos­
       sible to have equations within a <I>gremlin</I> figure by includ­
       ing in the <I>gremlin</I> file <I>eqn</I> expressions enclosed by previ­
       ously defined delimiters (e.g.  <I>$$</I>).

       When using <I>grn</I> along with other preprocessors, it is  best
       to  run  <I>tbl</I>  before <I>grn</I>, <I>pic</I>, and/or <I>ideal</I> to avoid over­
       working <I>tbl</I>.  <I>Eqn</I> should always be run last.

       A picture is considered an entity, but that  doesn't  stop
       <I>troff</I>  from  trying to break it up if it falls off the end
       of a page.  Placing the picture  between  `keeps'  in  -me
       macros will ensure proper placement.

       <I>grn</I>  uses  <I>troff</I>'s number registers <B>g1</B> through <B>g9</B> and sets
       registers <B>g1</B> and <B>g2</B> to the width and height of the <I>gremlin</I>
       figure  (in  device units) before entering the <B>.GS</B> request
       (this is for those who want to rewrite these macros).


</PRE>
<H2>GREMLIN FILE FORMAT</H2><PRE>
       There exist two distinct <I>gremlin</I> file formats, the  origi­
       nal  format from the <I>AED</I> graphic terminal version, and the
       <I>SUN</I> or <I>X11</I> version.  An extension to the  <I>SUN</I>/<I>X11</I>  version
       allowing reference points with negative coordinates is <B>not</B>
       compatible with the <I>AED</I> version.  As  long  as  a  <I>gremlin</I>
       file  does not contain negative coordinates, either format
       will be read correctly by either  version  of  <I>gremlin</I>  or
       <I>grn</I>.   The  other  difference to the <I>SUN</I>/<I>X11</I> format is the
       use of names for picture objects  (e.g.,  POLYGON,  CURVE)
       instead  of  numbers.  Files representing the same picture
       are shown in Table 1 in each format.

       ·      The first line of each <I>gremlin</I> file contains either
              the string <B>gremlinfile</B> (<I>AED</I> version) or <B>sungremlin­</B>
              <B>file</B> (<I>SUN</I>/<I>X11</I>)

       ·      The second line of the file  contains  an  orienta­
              tion,  and  <B>x</B> and <B>y</B> values for a positioning point,
              separated by spaces.  The orientation, either <B>0</B>  or
              <B>1</B>, is ignored by the <I>SUN</I>/<I>X11</I> version.  <B>0</B> means that
              <I>gremlin</I> will display things  in  horizontal  format
              (drawing  area  wider  than  it  is tall, with menu
              across top).  <B>1</B> means  that  <I>gremlin</I>  will  display
              things in vertical format (drawing area taller than
              it is wide, with menu on left side).  <B>x</B> and  <B>y</B>  are
              floating point values giving a positioning point to
              be used when this file is read into  another  file.
              The stuff on this line really isn't all that impor­
              tant; a value of ``1 0.00 0.00'' is suggested.

       ·      The rest of the file consists of zero or more  ele­
              ment specifications.  After the last element speci­
              fication is a line containing the string ``-1''.

              For  polygons,  one  more  value,  0, is legal.  It
              specifies a polygon with an invisible border.   For
              text, the brush selects a font as follows:

                      1 -       roman (R font in groff)
                      2 -       italics (I font in groff)
                      3 -       bold (B font in groff)
                      4 -       special (S font in groff)

              If  you're  using  <I>grn</I> to run your pictures through
              <I>groff</I>, the font is really just a starting font: The
              text  string  can contain formatting sequences like
              ``\fI'' or ``\d'' which may  change  the  font  (as
              well  as do many other things).  For text, the size
              field is a decimal  value  between  1  and  4.   It
              selects the size of the font in which the text will
              be drawn.  For polygons, this size field is  inter­
              preted  as  a  stipple  number  to fill the polygon
              with.  The number is used to index into  a  stipple
              font at print time.

       ·      The  last  line  of each element contains a decimal
              number and a string of characters, separated  by  a
              single  space.  The number is a count of the number
              of characters in the string.  This  information  is
              only  used for text elements, and contains the text
              string.  There can be spaces inside the text.   For
              arcs, curves, and vectors, this line of the element
              contains the string ``0''.

<H2>NOTES ON COORDINATES</H2><PRE>
       <I>gremlin</I> was designed for <I>AED</I>s, and its coordinates reflect
       the <I>AED</I> coordinate space.  For vertical pictures, x-values
       range 116 to 511, and y-values from 0 to 483.   For  hori­
       zontal pictures, x-values range from 0 to 511 and y-values
       range from 0 to  367.   Although  you  needn't  absolutely
       stick  to  this  range,  you'll get best results if you at
       least stay in this vicinity.  Also, point lists are termi­
       nated  by  a  point of (-1, -1), so you shouldn't ever use
       negative  coordinates.   <I>gremlin</I>  writes  out  coordinates
       using  format  ``%f1.2''; it's probably a good idea to use
       the same format if you want to modify the <I>grn</I> code.
