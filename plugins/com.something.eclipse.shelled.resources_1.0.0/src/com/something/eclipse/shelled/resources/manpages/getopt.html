       parameters


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>getopt</B> is used to break  up  (<I>parse</I>)  options  in  command
       lines  for  easy parsing by shell procedures, and to check
       for legal options.  It uses the GNU <B>getopt(3)</B> routines  to
       do this.

       The  parameters  <B>getopt</B> is called with can be divided into
       two parts: options which modify the way getopt will  parse
       (<I>options</I>  and <I>-o|--options</I> <I>optstring</I> in the <B>SYNOPSIS),</B> and
       the parameters which are to be parsed (<I>parameters</I>  in  the
       <B>SYNOPSIS).</B>   The  second  part  will  start  at  the first
       non-option parameter that is not an  option  argument,  or
       after  the  first  occurence  of  `<B>--</B>'.   If  no  `<B>-o</B>'  or
       `<B>--options</B>' option is found in the first part,  the  first
       parameter  of the second part is used as the short options
       string.

       If the environment variable <B>GETOPT_COMPATIBLE</B> is  set,  or
       if  its  first  parameter is not an option (does not start
       with a `<B>-</B>', this is the first  format  in  the  <B>SYNOPSIS),</B>
       <B>getopt</B>  will  generate output that is compatible with that
       of other versions of <B>getopt(1)</B>.  It will still do  parame­
       ter  shuffling  and recognize optional arguments (see sec­
       tion <B>COMPATIBILITY</B> for more information).

       Traditional implementations of  <B>getopt(1)</B>  are  unable  to
       cope  with  whitespace  and other (shell-specific) special
       characters in  arguments  and  non-option  parameters.  To
       solve  this  problem,  this  implementation  can  generate
       quoted output which must once again be interpreted by  the
       shell  (usually  by  using the <B>eval</B> command). This has the
       effect of preserving those characters, but you  must  call
       <B>getopt</B>  in  a  way that is no longer compatible with other
       versions (the second or third format in the <B>SYNOPSIS).</B>  To
       determine  whether  this  enhanced version of <B>getopt(1)</B> is
       installed, a special test option (<B>-T</B>) can be used.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       -a, --alternative
              Allow long options to start with a single `<B>-</B>'.

       -h, --help
              Output a small usage guide and exit succesfully. No
              other output is generated.
              <B>getopt(1)</B> are still reported as coming from getopt.

       -o, --options shortopts
              The short (one-character) options to be recognized.
              If this option is not found, the first parameter of
              <B>getopt</B>  that  does not start with a `<B>-</B>' (and is not
              an option argument) is used as  the  short  options
              string.   Each  short option character in <I>shortopts</I>
              may be followed by one colon to indicate it  has  a
              required argument, and by two colons to indicate it
              has an optional argument.  The first  character  of
              shortopts  may  be  `<B>+</B>' or `<B>-</B>' to influence the way
              options are parsed and  output  is  generated  (see
              section <B>SCANNING</B> <B>MODES</B> for details).

       -q, --quiet
              Disable error reporting by <B>getopt(3)</B>.

       -Q, --quiet-output
              Do  not  generate  normal  output. Errors are still
              reported by <B>getopt(3)</B>, unless you also use <I>-q</I>.

       -s, --shell shell
              Set quoting conventions to those of shell. If no -s
              argument  is  found, the BASH conventions are used.
              Valid arguments are currently `<B>sh</B>'  `<B>bash</B>',  `<B>csh</B>',
              and `<B>tcsh</B>'.

       -u, --unquoted
              Do  not  quote the output. Note that whitespace and
              special  (shell-dependent)  characters  can   cause
              havoc  in  this  mode  (like  they  do  with  other
              <B>getopt(1)</B> implementations).

       -T --test
              Test if your <B>getopt(1)</B> is this enhanced version  or
              an  old version. This generates no output, and sets
              the error status to  4.  Other  implementations  of
              <B>getopt(1)</B>,  and  this  version  if  the environment
              variable <B>GETOPT_COMPATIBLE</B> is set, will return `<B>--</B>'
              and error status 0.

       -V, --version
              Output version information and exit succesfully. No
              other output is generated.


</PRE>
<H2>PARSING</H2><PRE>
       This section specifies the format of the  second  part  of
       the parameters of <B>getopt</B> (the <I>parameters</I> in the <B>SYNOPSIS</B>).
       The next section (<B>OUTPUT</B>) describes  the  output  that  is
       generated.  These parameters were typically the parameters
       a shell function was called with.  Care must be taken that
       written directly after the option character if present.

       It  is possible to specify several short options after one
       `<B>-</B>', as long as all (except possibly the last) do not have
       required or optional arguments.

       A  long  option  normally begins with `<B>--</B>' followed by the
       long option name.  If the option has a required  argument,
       it  may  be  written  directly after the long option name,
       separated by `<B>=</B>', or as the next argument  (ie.  separated
       by  whitespace on the command line).  If the option has an
       optional argument, it must be written directly  after  the
       long option name, separated by `<B>=</B>', if present (if you add
       the `<B>=</B>' but nothing behind it, it is interpreted as if  no
       argument was present; this is a slight bug, see the <B>BUGS</B>).
       Long options may be abbreviated, as long as the  abbrevia­
       tion is not ambiguous.

       Each parameter not starting with a `<B>-</B>', and not a required
       argument of a previous option, is a non-option  parameter.
       Each  parameter  after  a  `<B>--</B>' parameter is always inter­
       preted as a  non-option  parameter.   If  the  environment
       variable  <B>POSIXLY_CORRECT</B>  is  set, or if the short option
       string started with a `<B>+</B>', all  remaining  parameters  are
       interpreted  as non-option parameters as soon as the first
       non-option parameter is found.


</PRE>
<H2>OUTPUT</H2><PRE>
       Output is generated for each element described in the pre­
       vious  section.   Output  is done in the same order as the
       elements are specified in the input, except for non-option
       parameters.  Output  can  be done in <I>compatible</I> (<I>unquoted</I>)
       mode, or in such way that  whitespace  and  other  special
       characters  within arguments and non-option parameters are
       preserved (see <B>QUOTING</B>).  When the output is processed  in
       the  shell script, it will seem to be composed of distinct
       elements that can be processed one by one  (by  using  the
       shift  command in most shell languages). This is imperfect
       in unquoted mode, as elements can be split  at  unexpected
       places if they contain whitespace or special characters.

       If  there are problems parsing the parameters, for example
       because a required argument is not found or an  option  is
       not recognized, an error will be reported on stderr, there
       will be  no  output  for  the  offending  element,  and  a
       non-zero error status is returned.

       For  a short option, a single `<B>-</B>' and the option character
       are generated as one parameter. If the option has an argu­
       ment,  the  next  parameter  will  be the argument. If the
       option takes an optional argument, but none was found, the
       next  parameter  will be generated but be empty in quoting
       Normally,  no  non-option  parameters  output is generated
       until all options and their arguments have been generated.
       Then `<B>--</B>' is generated as a single parameter, and after it
       the non-option parameters in the order  they  were  found,
       each as a separate parameter.  Only if the first character
       of the short options string was a `<B>-</B>', non-option  parame­
       ter output is generated at the place they are found in the
       input (this is not supported if the first  format  of  the
       <B>SYNOPSIS</B> is used; in that case all preceding occurences of
       `<B>-</B>' and `<B>+</B>' are ignored).


</PRE>
<H2>QUOTING</H2><PRE>
       In compatible mode, whitespace or 'special' characters  in
       arguments  or  non-option  parameters are not handled cor­
       rectly. As the output is fed  to  the  shell  script,  the
       script  does not know how it is supposed to break the out­
       put into separate parameters.  To circumvent this problem,
       this  implementation offers quoting. The idea is that out­
       put is generated with quotes around each  parameter.  When
       this  output  is once again fed to the shell (usually by a
       shell <B>eval</B> command), it is split correctly  into  separate
       parameters.

       Quoting   is  not  enabled  if  the  environment  variable
       <B>GETOPT_COMPATIBLE</B> is set, if the first form of the  <B>SYNOP­</B>
       <B>SIS</B> is used, or if the option `<B>-u</B>' is found.

       Different  shells  use  different quoting conventions. You
       can use the `<B>-s</B>' option to select the shell you are using.
       The   following  shells  are  currently  supported:  `<B>sh</B>',
       `<B>bash</B>', `<B>csh</B>' and `<B>tcsh</B>'.  Actually,  only  two  `flavors'
       are   distinguished:   sh-like   quoting  conventions  and
       csh-like quoting conventions. Chances are that if you  use
       another  shell  script  language, one of these flavors can
       still be used.



</PRE>
<H2>SCANNING MODES</H2><PRE>
       The first character of the short options string may  be  a
       `<B>-</B>'  or  a `<B>+</B>' to indicate a special scanning mode. If the
       first calling form  in  the  <B>SYNOPSIS</B>  is  used  they  are
       ignored; the environment variable <B>POSIXLY_CORRECT</B> is still
       examined, though.

       If the first character is `<B>+</B>', or if the environment vari­
       able  <B>POSIXLY_CORRECT</B> is set, parsing stops as soon as the
       first non-option parameter (ie. a parameter that does  not
       start with a `<B>-</B>') is found that is not an option argument.
       The remaining parameters are all interpreted as non-option
       parameters.

       If the first character is a `<B>-</B>', non-option parameters are
       interpret  its  first  parameter  as  the  string of short
       options, and all other arguments will be parsed.  It  will
       still  do  parameter shuffling (ie. all non-option parame­
       ters are outputed at  the  end),  unless  the  environment
       variable <B>POSIXLY_CORRECT</B> is set.

       The  environment  variable <B>GETOPT_COMPATIBLE</B> forces <B>getopt</B>
       into compatibility mode.  Setting  both  this  environment
       variable and <B>POSIXLY_CORRECT</B> offers 100% compatibility for
       `difficult' programs. Usually, though, neither is  needed.

       In  compatibility  mode, leading `<B>-</B>' and `<B>+</B>' characters in
       the short options string are ignored.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN CODES</H2><PRE>
       <B>getopt</B> returns error code <B>0</B> for succesful  parsing,  <B>1</B>  if
       <B>getopt(3)</B>  returns errors, <B>2</B> if it does not understand its
       own  parameters,  <B>3</B>  if  an  internal  error  occurs  like
       out-of-memory, and <B>4</B> if it is called with <B>-T</B>.


</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
       Example  scripts  for  (ba)sh and (t)csh are provided with
       the <B>getopt(1)</B> distribution, and are  optionally  installed
       in <B>/usr/local/lib/getopt</B> or <B>/usr/lib/getopt</B>.


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              This   environment  variable  is  examined  by  the
              <B>getopt(3)</B> routines.  If it is set, parsing stops as
              soon  as a parameter is found that is not an option
              or an option argument. All remaining parameters are
              also  interpreted as non-option parameters, regard­
              less whether they start with a `<B>-</B>'.

       GETOPT_COMPATIBLE
              Forces <B>getopt</B> to use the first  calling  format  as
              specified in the <B>SYNOPSIS</B>.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       <B>getopt(3)</B>  can  parse long options with optional arguments
       that are given an empty optional argument (but can not  do
       this  for  short  options). This <B>getopt(1)</B> treats optional
       arguments that are empty as if they were not present.

       The syntax if you do not want any short  option  variables
       at  all  is  not  very  intuitive  (you  have  to set them
       explicitely to the empty string).
