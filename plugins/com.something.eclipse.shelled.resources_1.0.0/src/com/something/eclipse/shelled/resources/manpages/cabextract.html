<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>cabextract</B>  is  a  program  that  un-archives files in the
       Microsoft cabinet file format (.cab) or  any  binary  file
       which  contains an embedded cabinet file (frequently found
       in .exe files).

       <B>cabextract</B> will extract all files from all  cabinet  files
       specified on the command line

       To  extract  a  multi-part  cabinet  consisting of several
       files, only give the <I>first</I> file as an argument  to  <B>cabex­</B>
       <B>tract</B>  as  it  will  automatically  look for the remaining
       files.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       A summary of options is included below.

       <B>-v</B>     If given alone on the command line, prints the ver­
              sion  of <B>cabextract</B> and exits. Given with a list of
              cabinet files, it will list  the  contents  of  the
              cabinet files.

       <B>-h</B>     Prints a page of help and exits.

       <B>-l</B>     Lists  the  contents  of  the  given cabinet files,
              rather than extracting them.

       <B>-q</B>     When extracting cabinet files, supresses  all  mes­
              sages except errors and warnings.

       <B>-L</B>     When extracting cabinet files, makes each extracted
              file's name lowercase.

       <B>-f</B>     When extracting cabinet  files,  will  ignore  cor­
              rupted MSZIP blocks. A warning will be printed if a
              corrupted MSZIP block is encountered.

       <B>-d</B> <I>dir</I> Extracts all files into the directory <I>dir</I> .
