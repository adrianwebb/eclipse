       <B>namei</B> <I>[-mx]</I> <I>pathname</I> <I>[</I> <I>pathname</I> <I>...</I> <I>]</I>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>Namei</I>  uses its arguments as pathnames to any type of Unix
       file (symlinks, files, directories, and so forth).   <I>Namei</I>
       then follows each pathname until a terminal point is found
       (a file, directory, char device, etc).  If it finds a sym­
       bolic  link,  we  show  the  link, and start following it,
       indenting the output to show the context.

       This program is useful for finding a "too many  levels  of
       symbolic links" problems.

       For  each line output, <I>namei</I> outputs a the following char­
       acters to identify the file types found:

          f: = the pathname we are currently trying to resolve
           d = directory
           l = symbolic link (both the link and it's contents are output)
           s = socket
           b = block device
           c = character device
           - = regular file
           ? = an error of some kind

       <I>Namei</I> prints an informative message when the maximum  num­
       ber  of  symbolic  links  this  system  can  have has been
       exceeded.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-x</B>      Show mount point directories with  a  'D',  rather
               than a 'd'.

       <B>-m</B>      Show  the mode bits of each file type in the style
               of <B>ls(1)</B>, for example 'rwxr-xr-x'.

</PRE>
<H2>CAVEATS</H2><PRE>
       <I>Namei</I> will follow an infinite loop of symbolic links  for­
       ever.  To escape, use SIGINT (usually ^C).
