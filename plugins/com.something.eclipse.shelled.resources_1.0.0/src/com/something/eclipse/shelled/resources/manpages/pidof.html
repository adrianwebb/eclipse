       <B>pidof</B> [<B>-s</B>] [<B>-x</B>] [<B>-o</B> <I>omitpid</I>] [<B>-o</B> <I>omitpid..</I>]  <B>program</B> [<B>pro­</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>Pidof</B> finds the process id's (pids) of the named programs.
       It  prints those id's on the standard output. This program
       is on some systems used in run-level change scripts, espe­
       cially  when  the system has a <I>System-V</I> like <I>rc</I> structure.
       In that case these  scripts  are  located  in  /etc/rc?.d,
       where  ?  is the runlevel. If the system has a <B>start-stop-</B>
       <B>daemon</B> (8) program that should be used instead.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       -s     Single shot - this instructs the  program  to  only
              return one <I>pid</I>.

       -x     Scripts  too  -  this  causes  the  program to also
              return process id's of  shells  running  the  named
              scripts.

       -o     Tells <I>pidof</I> to omit processes with that process id.
              The special pid <B>%PPID</B> can be used to name the  par­
              ent  process  of  the <I>pidof</I> program, in other words
              the calling shell or shell script.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       <I>pidof</I> is simply a (symbolic) link to the <I>killall5</I> program,
       which should also be located in <I>/sbin</I>.

       When  <I>pidof</I> is invoked with a full pathname to the program
       it should find the pid of, it is reasonably  safe.  Other­
       wise  it  is possible that it returns pids of running pro­
       grams that happen to have the same  name  as  the  program
       you're after but are actually other programs.
