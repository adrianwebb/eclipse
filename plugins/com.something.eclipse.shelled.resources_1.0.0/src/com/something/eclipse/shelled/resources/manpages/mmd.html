<H2>Note of warning</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation, and may  not  be  entirely
       accurate  or  complete.   See the end of this man page for

<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       The mmd command is used to make  an  MS-DOS  subdirectory.
       Its syntax is:

       mmd [-D <I>clash</I><B>_</B><I>option</I>] <I>msdosdirectory</I> [ <I>msdosdirectories</I>...
       ]

       Mmd makes a new directory  on  an  MS-DOS  filesystem.  An
       error occurs if the directory already exists.

<H2>Viewing the texi doc</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this  process  is
       only  approximative,  and  some items, such as crossrefer­
       ences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  translation
       process.   Indeed,  these items have no appropriate repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I strongly advise you to use  the  original  texinfo  doc.
       See  the  end of this manpage for instructions how to view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo  doc,
