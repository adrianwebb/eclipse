<h1 class="Head">Organizing R Breakpoints</h1>

<p>R breakpoints in StatET are saved and loaded with the Eclipse workspace and are organized 
independently of running R consoles.</p>

<h3>Adding Breakpoints</h3>

<p>To set a breakpoint to a line of an R script file, you have to open the file in the source 
editor.  Only files in a project in the Eclipse workspace are supported.</p>

<h4>Commands</h4>

<table class="style1">
<thead><tr>
	<th></th>
	<th>Name</th>
	<th>Description</th>
	<th>Availability</th>
</tr></thead>
<tr>
	<td><img alt="Icon" src="../icons/obj/r_breakpoint.png" style="vertical-align: text-top"/></td>
	<td><span class="uilabel">Toggle Breakpoint</span></td>
	<td><p>If any breakpoint already exists at the line selected in the editor, that breakpoint is 
		removed.  Otherwise StatET tries to create a new breakpoint at the given line.  
		StatET directly validates the position of the breakpoint and adapts it, if required.
		The type of the created breakpoint is chosen automatically dependent on the selected 
		position.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the position is in a function header, it create a <a href="r_debug-breakpoints-method_breakpoints.xhtml"
				>method breakpoint</a>.</li>
			<li>Otherwise it creates a common <a href="r_debug-breakpoints-line_breakpoints.xhtml"
				>line breakpoint</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>When executing this command in the editor ruler using the mouse, the position of the 
		mouse cursor and not the text selection in the editor is used.</p>
		<p>The command is also executed when <b>double-clicking</b> on the editor ruler next 
			to the source code line.</p>
	</td>
	<td class="accesslist">Main menu (<span class="uisequence">Run</span>)<br/>
		Local command<br/>
		<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+B</kbd><br/>
		Editor ruler</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img alt="Icon" src="../icons/obj/r_breakpoint.png" style="vertical-align: text-top"/></td>
	<td><span class="uilabel">Toggle Line Breakpoint</span></td>
	<td>This command removes or creates <a href="r_debug-breakpoints-line_breakpoints.xhtml"
		>line breakpoints</a> only.  If a line breakpoint already exists at the line selected in 
		the editor, that breakpoint is removed.  Otherwise StatET tries to create a new line 
		breakpoint at the given line.
		StatET directly validates the position of the breakpoint and adapts it, if required.
		</td>
	<td class="accesslist">Main menu (<span class="uisequence">Run</span>)<br/>
		Local command</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img alt="Icon" src="../icons/obj/r_breakpoint.png" style="vertical-align: text-top"/></td>
	<td><span class="uilabel">Toggle Method Breakpoint</span></td>
	<td>This command removes or creates <a href="r_debug-breakpoints-method_breakpoints.xhtml"
		>method breakpoints</a> only.  If a method breakpoint already exists for the function
		surrounding text selection in the editor, that breakpoint is removed.  Otherwise StatET 
		tries to create a new method breakpoint for that function.
		</td>
	<td class="accesslist">Main menu (<span class="uisequence">Run</span>)<br/>
		Local command</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If a new breakpoint is created, its icon appears in the editor ruler and in the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/views/breakpoints/ref-breakpoints_view.htm"
>Breakpoint view</a>.</p>
<p>For all open R console running in debug mode in the Eclipse workbench, StatET also tries to 
install the newly created breakpoints in R.</p>


<h3>Removing Breakpoints</h3>

<p>Since the ways to create a method breakpoint described above are toggle operation, you can 
also use them again to remove the method breakpoint.  Beside that, the Breakpoint view offers
additional actions to remove the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/views/breakpoints/ref-remove_viewaction.htm"
>selected</a> or <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/views/breakpoints/ref-removeall_viewaction.htm"
>all</a> breakpoints.</p>

<p>If the Eclipse workbench has open R console running in debug mode, StatET also tries to uninstall 
the removed breakpoints from R.  In any case, the breakpoint is also directly disabled, so it 
will no longer suspend any thread.</p>


<h2 id="installed">Installed Breakpoints</h2>

<p>For R consoles running in debug mode in the current Eclipse workbench, StatET tries to install 
the breakpoints in R.  A breakpoint can only be installed when the R code the breakpoint belongs 
to is loaded in R, e.g. the function or S4 method is assigned to an environment in the 'search' 
path in R.  Additionally it is required, that the function in R must be created with source 
references (see <a href="r_debug-notes.xhtml">Important Notes</a>).  
If a breakpoint is successfully installed, its icon shows an checkmark overlay 
(<img alt="Icon" src="../icons/obj/r_breakpoint-installed.png" style="vertical-align: text-top"/>).  
Note that this indicator in the icon can be wrong at a later time in the R console session, 
e.g. when the R element is removed or untrace manually by the user.</p>

<p>Breakpoints are installed automatically by StatET when:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The user starts a new R console or reconnects to a running R console; StatET tries to
	update the installation of all breakpoints.</li>
	<li>The user submits R code containing breakpoints; StatET tries to install the breakpoints
	relevant for that code.</li>
	<li>A package is loaded to the R workspace. If this package exists in the Eclipse workspace,
	StatET tries to install all breakpoints in this project.</li>
</ul>
