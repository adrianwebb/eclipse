<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>Col</B> filters out reverse (and half reverse) line feeds so the output is in
     the correct order with only forward and half forward line feeds, and
     replaces white-space characters with tabs where possible.  This can be
     useful in processing the output of <B>nroff(1)</B> and <B>tbl(1)</B>.

     <B>Col</B> reads from standard input and writes to standard output.

     The options are as follows:

     <B>-b</B>     Do not output any backspaces, printing only the last character
            written to each column position.

     <B>-f</B>     Forward half line feeds are permitted (``fine'' mode).  Normally
            characters printed on a half line boundary are printed on the fol­
            lowing line.

     <B>-p</B>     Force unknown control sequences to be passed through unchanged.
            Normally, <B>col</B> will filter out any control sequences from the input
            other than those recognized and interpreted by itself, which are
            listed below.

     <B>-x</B>     Output multiple spaces instead of tabs.

     <B>-l</B><I>num</I>  Buffer at least <I>num</I> lines in memory.  By default, 128 lines are
            buffered.

     The control sequences for carriage motion that <B>col</B> understands and their
     decimal values are listed in the following table:

     ESC-7            reverse line feed (escape then 7)
     ESC-8            half reverse line feed (escape then 8)
     ESC-9            half forward line feed (escape then 9)
     backspace        moves back one column (8); ignored in the first column
     carriage return  (13)
     newline          forward line feed (10); also does carriage return
     shift in         shift to normal character set (15)
     shift out        shift to alternate character set (14)
     space            moves forward one column (32)
     tab              moves forward to next tab stop (9)
     vertical tab     reverse line feed (11)

     All unrecognized control characters and escape sequences are discarded.

     <B>Col</B> keeps track of the character set as characters are read and makes
     sure the character set is correct when they are output.

     If the input attempts to back up to the last flushed line, <B>col</B> will dis­
     play a warning message.
