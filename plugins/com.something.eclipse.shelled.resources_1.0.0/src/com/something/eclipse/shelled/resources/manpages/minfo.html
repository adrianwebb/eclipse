       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation, and may  not  be  entirely

<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       The minfo command prints the parameters of a Dos  filesys­
       tem,  such  as number of sectors, heads and cylinders.  It
       also prints an mformat command line which can be  used  to
       create  a  similar  Dos filesystem on another media.  How­
       ever, this doesn't work with 2m or Xdf media, and with Dos
       1.0 filesystems
       minfo <I>drive</I>:

       v      Prints  a hexdump of the bootsector, in addition to
              the other information

<H2>Viewing the texi doc</H2><PRE>
       This  manpage  has  been  automatically   generated   from
       mtools's  texinfo  documentation. However, this process is
       only approximative, and some items,  such  as  crossrefer­
       ences,  footnotes and indices are lost in this translation
       process.  Indeed, these items have no  appropriate  repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I  strongly  advise  you  to use the original texinfo doc.
       See the end of this manpage for instructions how  to  view
       the texinfo doc.
