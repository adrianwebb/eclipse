<H2>Note of warning</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation, and may  not  be  entirely
       accurate  or  complete.   See the end of this man page for
       details.

<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       The mmove command is used to moves or renames an  existing
       MS-DOS file or subdirectory.
       mmove [-v] [-D <I>clash</I><B>_</B><I>option</I>] <I>sourcefile</I> <I>targetfile</I>
       mmove [-v]  [-D <I>clash</I><B>_</B><I>option</I>] <I>sourcefile</I> [ <I>sourcefiles</I>... ] <I>targetdirectory</I>

       Mmove  moves  or renames an existing MS-DOS file or subdi­
       rectory. Unlike the MS-DOS version of MOVE, mmove is  able
       to  move subdirectories.  Files or directories can only be
       moved within one filesystem. Data cannot be moved from Dos
       to  Unix or vice-versa.  If you omit the drive letter from
       the target file or directory, the same letter as  for  the
       source  is assumed.  If you omit the drive letter from all
       parameters, drive a: is assumed by default.

<H2>Viewing the texi doc</H2><PRE>
       This  manpage  has  been  automatically   generated   from
       mtools's  texinfo  documentation. However, this process is
       only approximative, and some items,  such  as  crossrefer­
       ences,  footnotes and indices are lost in this translation
       process.  Indeed, these items have no  appropriate  repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I  strongly  advise  you  to use the original texinfo doc.
       See the end of this manpage for instructions how  to  view
       the texinfo doc.
