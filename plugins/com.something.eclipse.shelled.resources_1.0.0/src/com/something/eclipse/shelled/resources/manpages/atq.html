<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>at</B> and <B>batch</B> read commands from standard input or a speci­
       fied  file which are to be executed at a later time, using
       <B>/bin/sh</B>.

       <B>at</B>      executes commands at a specified time.

       <B>atq</B>     lists the user's pending jobs, unless the user  is
               the  superuser; in that case, everybody's jobs are
               listed.  The format of the output lines  (one  for
               each job) is: Job number, date, hour, job class.

       <B>atrm</B>    deletes jobs, identified by their job number.

       <B>batch</B>   executes  commands when system load levels permit;
               in other words, when the load average drops  below
               0.8,  or  the value specified in the invocation of
               <B>atrun</B>.

       <B>At</B> allows fairly complex  time  specifications,  extending
       the  POSIX.2 standard.  It accepts times of the form <B>HH:MM</B>
       to run a job at a specific time of day.  (If that time  is
       already  past,  the  next  day  is assumed.)  You may also
       specify <B>midnight,</B> <B>noon,</B> or <B>teatime</B> (4pm) and you can  have
       a  time-of-day  suffixed  with <B>AM</B> or <B>PM</B> for running in the
       morning or the evening.  You can also say what day the job
       will  be  run, by giving a date in the form <B>month-name</B> <B>day</B>
       with an optional <B>year,</B> or giving a date of the form <B>MMDDYY</B>
       or <B>MM/DD/YY</B> or <B>DD.MM.YY.</B>  The specification of a date <I>must</I>
       follow the specification of the time of day.  You can also
       give  times  like  <B>now</B> <B>+</B> <I>count</I> <I>time-units,</I> where the time-
       units can be <B>minutes,</B> <B>hours,</B> <B>days,</B> or <B>weeks</B>  and  you  can
       tell  <B>at</B>  to  run the job today by suffixing the time with
       <B>today</B> and to run the job tomorrow by  suffixing  the  time
       with <B>tomorrow.</B>

       For  example, to run a job at 4pm three days from now, you
       would do <B>at</B> <B>4pm</B> <B>+</B> <B>3</B> <B>days,</B> to run a job at 10:00am on  July
       31,  you  would  do <B>at</B> <B>10am</B> <B>Jul</B> <B>31</B> and to run a job at 1am
       tomorrow, you would do <B>at</B> <B>1am</B> <B>tomorrow.</B>

       The exact definition of  the  time  specification  can  be
       found in <I>/usr/share/doc/packages/at/timespec</I>.

       files <I>/etc/at.allow</I> and <I>/etc/at.deny</I>.

       If the file <I>/etc/at.allow</I> exists, only usernames mentioned
       in it are allowed to use <B>at</B>.

       If <I>/etc/at.allow</I> does not exist, <I>/etc/at.deny</I> is  checked,
       every  username not mentioned in it is then allowed to use
       <B>at</B>.

       If neither exists, only the superuser is  allowed  use  of
       at.

       An empty <I>/etc/at.deny</I> means that every user is allowed use
       these commands, this is the default configuration.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-V</B>      prints the version number to standard error.

       <B>-q</B> <I>queue</I>
               uses the specified  queue.   A  queue  designation
               consists  of a single letter; valid queue designa­
               tions range from <B>a</B> to <B>z</B>.  and <B>A</B> to <B>Z</B>.  The <B>a</B> queue
               is  the  default for <B>at</B> and the <B>b</B> queue for <B>batch</B>.
               Queues with  higher  letters  run  with  increased
               niceness.   The  special queue "=" is reserved for
               jobs which are currently running.

       If a job is submitted to a queue designated with an upper­
       case  letter, it is treated as if it had been submitted to
       batch at that time.  If <B>atq</B> is given a specific queue,  it
       will only show jobs pending in that queue.

       <B>-m</B>      Send  mail  to the user when the job has completed
               even if there was no output.

       <B>-f</B> <I>file</I> Reads the  job  from  <B>file</B>  rather  than  standard
               input.

       <B>-l</B>      Is an alias for <B>atq.</B>

       <B>-d</B>      Is an alias for <B>atrm.</B>


       <B>-v</B>      Shows the time the job will be executed.

       Times  displayed  will be in the format "1997-02-20
       14:50" unless the environment variable <B>POSIXLY_COR­</B>
       <B>RECT</B>  is set; then, it will be "Thu Feb 20 14:50:00
       1996".

       <B>-c</B>     cats the jobs listed on the command line  to
              standard output.

       the presence of a <I>proc</I>- type directory  mounted  on
       <I>/proc</I>.

       If  the file <I>/var/run/utmp</I> is not available or cor­
       rupted, or if the user is not logged on at the time
       <B>at</B> is invoked, the mail is sent to the userid found
       in the environment variable <B>LOGNAME</B>.   If  that  is
       undefined  or empty, the current userid is assumed.

       <B>At</B> and <B>batch</B> as presently implemented are not suit­
       able  when  users  are competing for resources.  If
       this is the case for your site, you might  want  to
       consider another batch system, such as <B>nqs</B>.
