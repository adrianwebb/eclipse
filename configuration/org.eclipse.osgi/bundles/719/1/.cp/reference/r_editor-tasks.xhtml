<h1>Tasks</h1>

<p>The associated tasks described here are Eclipse's way of keeping track of small notes 
that are part of the code.
By default StatET defines two different keywords that will allow Eclipse
to highlight the tasks in the code and offer the information in a Tasks View:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>TODO</code></li>
	<li><code>FIXME</code></li></ul>
<p>The meaning of the task tags is self-explanatory.</p>

<h4>Creation of tasks by task tags</h4>
<p>The tasks will be recognized as such if they are preceded with a single comment character 
and a single space, as in
	<code class="indent"># TODO: remove hard-coding of colours</code></p>
<p>The tasks are created or removed when the file changed and Eclipse runs a build. 
Usually this happens automatically when the file is saved in the R-editor. 
If automatic build in Eclipse is disabled, a manual build must be started 
to update the tasks 
(build commands are located in the menu <span class="uisequence">Project</span>).
If files was changed outside of Eclipse, refreshing the relevant folders of
the workspace in the Project Explorer let Eclipse detect the changes.</p>
<p>The creation of tasks by tasks tags in R files works only for files in R projects.</p>

<h4>Tasks in the editor</h4>
<p>The tasks appears as a type of Eclipse annotations in the editor.
Therefore, an individual task icon will be displayed in the left gutter.
In the right gutter, which gives an overview of all Eclipse annotations, 
the task annotations are indicated by small blue rectangles.
Clicking on such a rectangle will position the cursor on the corresponding task.</p>

<h4>Options</h4>
<p>One can edit and add or remove task keywords in the preferences at
	<span class="uisequence indent">StatET &gt; Task Tags</span></p>
<img style="width: 660px; height: 543px;" alt="Task tags preferences page" src="../images/screenshot_task_tags_prefs.png"/>

<p>The tags can also be configured per project.</p>
