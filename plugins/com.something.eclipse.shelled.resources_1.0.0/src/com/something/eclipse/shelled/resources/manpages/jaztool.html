<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Disk write-protection is done by software for Iomega's JAZ
       and ZIP drives.  <B>jaztool</B> and <B>ziptool</B> make  these  features
       available for Linux. Before performing any protection mode
       changes, it is checked that <I>device</I> is actually  a  JAZ  or
       ZIP  drive  and  that no partition of the inserted disk is
       currently mounted.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-e</B>      Eject the disk.

       <B>-ro</B>     Make disk read-only. If the current mode  is  pro­
               tected by a password, you are prompted for it.

       <B>-rp</B>     Make  disk  read-only and protect this mode with a
               password. The maximum length of a password  is  33
               characters.

               <B>WARNING:</B>  Don't forget the password! Otherwise you
               will have to reformat the disk in order to  remove
               write-protection.

       <B>-rw</B>     Remove  any  protection from the disk. If the cur­
               rent mode is protected  by  a  password,  you  are
               prompted for it.

       <B>-ld</B>     Lock the Drive door so the disk cannot be ejected.
               Only works if the disk is already mounted.

       <B>-ud</B>     Unlock the Drive door

       <B>-m</B>      Mount the device dev4 on [dir], then lock the door
               (like -ld)

       <B>-u</B>      Unmount the device dev4.

       <B>-s</B>      Get the current protection status. Supported modes
               are:

                      unprotected
                      write-protected
                      password write-protected


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       Changing password if the disk is password  write-protected
       is  currently  not  supported.  If  you want to change the
       password now you first have to remove protection from  the
       (grant@torque.net)  and  Itai Nahshon.  <B>jaztool</B> was origi­
       nally   written   by   Bob   Willmot   (bwillmot@cnct.com,
