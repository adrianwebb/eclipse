Applicable Licenses 
   
Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by Something Software Ltd is provided to you under the terms and conditions of the Common Public License Version 1.0
(&quot;CPL&quot;).  A copy of the CPL is provided with this Content and is also available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl-v10.html.

Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object code, documentation and other files maintained in the Something Software Ltd CVS repository (&quot;Repository&quot;) in CVS
modules (&quot;Modules&quot;) and made available as downloadable archives (&quot;Downloads&quot;).

Content may be apportioned into plug-ins (&quot;Plug-ins&quot;), plug-in fragments (&quot;Fragments&quot;), and features (&quot;Features&quot;). A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments and associated material. Files named &quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list of the names and version numbers of  the Plug-ins and/or Fragments associated with a Feature.   Plug-ins and Fragments are located in directories
named &quot;plugins&quot; and Features are located in directories named &quot;features&quot;.

The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should be contained in files named &quot;about.html&quot; (&quot;Abouts&quot;). The terms and conditions governing Features and
Included Features should be contained in files named &quot;license.html&quot; (&quot;Feature Licenses&quot;). Abouts and Feature Licenses may be located in any directory of a Download or Module
including, but not limited to the following locations:

- The top-level (root) directory
- Plug-in and Fragment directories
- Subdirectories of the directory named &quot;src&quot; of certain Plug-ins
- Feature directories

Note: if a Feature made available by Something Software Ltd is installed using the Eclipse Update Manager, you must agree to a license (&quot;Feature Update License&quot;) during the
installation process. If the Feature contains Included Features, the Feature Update License should either provide you with the terms and conditions governing the Included Features or
inform you where you can locate them. Feature Update Licenses may be found in the &quot;license&quot; property of files named &quot;feature.properties&quot;.
Such Abouts, Feature Licenses and Feature Update Licenses contain the terms and conditions (or references to such terms and conditions) that govern your use of the associated Content in
that directory.

THE ABOUTS, FEATURE LICENSES AND FEATURE UPDATE LICENSES MAY REFER TO THE CPL OR OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS, NOTICES OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

IT IS YOUR OBLIGATION TO READ AND ACCEPT ALL SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS PRIOR TO USE OF THE CONTENT.  If no About, Feature License or Feature Update License is provided, please
