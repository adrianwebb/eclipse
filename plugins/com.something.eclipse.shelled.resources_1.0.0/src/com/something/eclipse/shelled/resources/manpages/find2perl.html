               find2perl [paths] [predicates] | perl


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       find2perl is a little translator to convert find command
       lines to equivalent Perl code.  The resulting code is typ­
       ically faster than running find itself.

       "paths" are a set of paths where find2perl will start its
       searches and "predicates" are taken from the following
       list.

       "! PREDICATE"
           Negate the sense of the following predicate.  The "!"
           must be passed as a distinct argument, so it may need
           to be surrounded by whitespace and/or quoted from
           interpretation by the shell using a backslash (just as
           with using <B>find(1)</B>).

       "( PREDICATES )"
           Group the given PREDICATES.  The parentheses must be
           passed as distinct arguments, so they may need to be
           surrounded by whitespace and/or quoted from interpre­
           tation by the shell using a backslash (just as with
           using <B>find(1)</B>).

       "PREDICATE1 PREDICATE2"
           True if _both_ PREDICATE1 and PREDICATE2 are true;
           PREDICATE2 is not evaluated if PREDICATE1 is false.

       "PREDICATE1 -o PREDICATE2"
           True if either one of PREDICATE1 or PREDICATE2 is
           true; PREDICATE2 is not evaluated if PREDICATE1 is
           true.

       "-follow"
           Follow (dereference) symlinks.  The checking of file
           attributes depends on the position of the "-follow"
           option. If it precedes the file check option, an
           "stat" is done which means the file check applies to
           the file the symbolic link is pointing to. If "-fol­
           low" option follows the file check option, this now
           applies to the symbolic link itself, i.e.  an "lstat"
           is done.

       "-depth"
           Change directory traversal algorithm from breadth-
           first to depth-first.

       "-prune"
           Do not descend into the directory currently matched.

           missions.

       "-type X"
           The file's type matches perl's "-X" operator.

       "-fstype TYPE"
           Filesystem of current path is of type TYPE (only
           NFS/non-NFS distinction is implemented).

       "-user USER"
           True if USER is owner of file.

       "-group GROUP"
           True if file's group is GROUP.

       "-nouser"
           True if file's owner is not in password database.

       "-nogroup"
           True if file's group is not in group database.

       "-inum INUM"
           True file's inode number is INUM.

       "-links N"
           True if (hard) link count of file matches N (see
           below).

       "-size N"
           True if file's size matches N (see below) N is nor­
           mally counted in 512-byte blocks, but a suffix of "c"
           specifies that size should be counted in characters
           (bytes) and a suffix of "k" specifes that size should
           be counted in 1024-byte blocks.

       "-atime N"
           True if last-access time of file matches N (measured
           in days) (see below).

       "-ctime N"
           True if last-changed time of file's inode matches N
           (measured in days, see below).

       "-mtime N"
           True if last-modified time of file matches N (measured
           in days, see below).

       "-newer FILE"
           True if last-modified time of file matches N.

       "-print"
           Print out path of file (always true).

       "-ok OPTIONS ;"
           Like -exec, but first prompts user; if user's response
           does not begin with a y, skip the exec.  The ";" must
           be passed as a distinct argument, so it may need to be
           surrounded by whitespace and/or quoted from interpre­
           tation by the shell using a backslash (just as with
           using <B>find(1)</B>).

       "-eval EXPR"
           Has the perl script <I>eval()</I> the EXPR.

       "-ls"
           Simulates "-exec ls -dils {} ;"

       "-tar FILE"
           Adds current output to tar-format FILE.

       "-cpio FILE"
           Adds current output to old-style cpio-format FILE.

       "-ncpio FILE"
           Adds current output to "new"-style cpio-format FILE.

       Predicates which take a numeric argument N can come in
       three forms:

          * N is prefixed with a +: match values greater than N
          * N is prefixed with a -: match values less than N
          * N is not prefixed with either + or -: match only values equal to N
