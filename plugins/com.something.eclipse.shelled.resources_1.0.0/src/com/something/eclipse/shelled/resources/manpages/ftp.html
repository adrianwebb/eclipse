<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>ftp</B> is the user interface to the Internet standard File Transfer Proto­
     col.  The program allows a user to transfer files to and from a remote
     network site.

     The last five arguments will fetch a file using the FTP or HTTP proto­
     cols, or by direct copying, into the current directory.  This is ideal
     for scripts.  Refer to <I>AUTO-FETCHING</I> <I>FILES</I> below for more information.

     Options may be specified at the command line, or to the command inter­
     preter.

     <B>-A</B>       Force active mode ftp.  By default, <B>ftp</B> will try to use passive
              mode ftp and fall back to active mode if passive is not sup­
              ported by the server.  This option causes <B>ftp</B> to always use an
              active connection.  It is only useful for connecting to very old
              servers that do not implement passive mode properly.

     <B>-a</B>       Causes <B>ftp</B> to bypass normal login procedure, and use an anony­
              mous login instead.

     <B>-d</B>       Enables debugging.

     <B>-e</B>       Disables command line editing.  This is useful for Emacs ange-
              ftp mode.

     <B>-f</B>       Forces a cache reload for transfers that go through the FTP or
              HTTP proxies.

     <B>-g</B>       Disables file name globbing.

     <B>-i</B>       Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.

     <B>-n</B>       Restrains <B>ftp</B> from attempting ``auto-login'' upon initial con­
              nection.  If auto-login is enabled, <B>ftp</B> will check the <I>.netrc</I>
              (see below) file in the user's home directory for an entry
              describing an account on the remote machine.  If no entry
              exists, <B>ftp</B> will prompt for the remote machine login name
              (default is the user identity on the local machine), and, if
              necessary, prompt for a password and an account with which to
              login.

     <B>-o</B> <I>output</I>
              When auto-fetching files, save the contents in <I>output</I>.  <I>output</I>
              is parsed according to the <I>FILE</I> <I>NAMING</I> <I>CONVENTIONS</I> below.  If
              <I>output</I> is not `-' or doesn't start with `|', then only the first
              file specified will be retrieved into <I>output</I>; all other files

     <B>-t</B>       Enables packet tracing.

     <B>-T</B> <I>direction</I>,<I>maximum</I>[,<I>increment</I>]
              Set the maximum transfer rate for <I>direction</I> to <I>maximum</I>
              bytes/second, and if specified, the increment to <I>increment</I>
              bytes/second.  Refer to <B>rate</B> for more information.

     <B>-u</B> <I>url</I> <I>file</I> [...]
              Upload files on the command line to <I>url</I> where <I>url</I> is one of the
              ftp URL types as supported by auto-fetch (with an optional tar­
              get filename for single file uploads), and <I>file</I> is one or more
              local files to be uploaded.

     <B>-v</B>       Enable <B>verbose</B> and <B>progress</B>.  This is the default if output is
              to a terminal (and in the case of <B>progress</B>, <B>ftp</B> is the fore­
              ground process).  Forces <B>ftp</B> to show all responses from the
              remote server, as well as report on data transfer statistics.

     <B>-V</B>       Disable <B>verbose</B> and <B>progress</B>, overriding the default of enabled
              when output is to a terminal.

     The client host with which <B>ftp</B> is to communicate may be specified on the
     command line.  If this is done, <B>ftp</B> will immediately attempt to establish
     a connection to an FTP server on that host; otherwise, <B>ftp</B> will enter its
     command interpreter and await instructions from the user.  When <B>ftp</B> is
     awaiting commands from the user the prompt `ftp&gt;' is provided to the
     user.  The following commands are recognized by <B>ftp</B>:

     <B>!</B> [<I>command</I> [<I>args</I>]]
                 Invoke an interactive shell on the local machine.  If there
                 are arguments, the first is taken to be a command to execute
                 directly, with the rest of the arguments as its arguments.

     <B>$</B> <I>macro-name</I> [<I>args</I>]
                 Execute the macro <I>macro-name</I> that was defined with the <B>macdef</B>
                 command.  Arguments are passed to the macro unglobbed.

     <B>account</B> [<I>passwd</I>]
                 Supply a supplemental password required by a remote system
                 for access to resources once a login has been successfully
                 completed.  If no argument is included, the user will be
                 prompted for an account password in a non-echoing input mode.

     <B>append</B> <I>local-file</I> [<I>remote-file</I>]
                 Append a local file to a file on the remote machine.  If
                 <I>remote-file</I> is left unspecified, the local file name is used
                 in naming the remote file after being altered by any <B>ntrans</B>
                 or <B>nmap</B> setting.  File transfer uses the current settings for
                 <B>type</B>, <B>format</B>, <B>mode</B>, and <B>structure</B>.

     <B>ascii</B>       Set the file transfer <B>type</B> to network ASCII.  This is the
                 default type.

     <B>cd</B> <I>remote-directory</I>
                 Change the working directory on the remote machine to
                 <I>remote-directory</I>.

     <B>cdup</B>        Change the remote machine working directory to the parent of
                 the current remote machine working directory.

     <B>chmod</B> <I>mode</I> <I>remote-file</I>
                 Change the permission modes of the file <I>remote-file</I> on the
                 remote system to <I>mode</I>.

     <B>close</B>       Terminate the FTP session with the remote server, and return
                 to the command interpreter.  Any defined macros are erased.

     <B>cr</B>          Toggle carriage return stripping during ascii type file
                 retrieval.  Records are denoted by a carriage return/linefeed
                 sequence during ascii type file transfer.  When <B>cr</B> is on (the
                 default), carriage returns are stripped from this sequence to
                 conform with the UNIX single linefeed record delimiter.
                 Records on non-UNIX remote systems may contain single line­
                 feeds; when an ascii type transfer is made, these linefeeds
                 may be distinguished from a record delimiter only when <B>cr</B> is
                 off.

     <B>debug</B> [<I>debug-value</I>]
                 Toggle debugging mode.  If an optional <I>debug-value</I> is speci­
                 fied it is used to set the debugging level.  When debugging
                 is on, <B>ftp</B> prints each command sent to the remote machine,
                 preceded by the string `--&gt;'

     <B>delete</B> <I>remote-file</I>
                 Delete the file <I>remote-file</I> on the remote machine.

     <B>dir</B> [<I>remote-path</I> [<I>local-file</I>]]
                 Print a listing of the contents of a directory on the remote
                 machine.  The listing includes any system-dependent informa­
                 tion that the server chooses to include; for example, most
                 UNIX systems will produce output from the command `ls -l'.
                 If <I>remote-path</I> is left unspecified, the current working
                 directory is used.  If interactive prompting is on, <B>ftp</B> will
                 prompt the user to verify that the last argument is indeed
                 the target local file for receiving <B>dir</B> output.  If no local
                 file is specified, or if <I>local-file</I> is `<B>-</B>', the output is
                 sent to the terminal.

     <B>disconnect</B>  A synonym for <B>close</B>.

     <B>edit</B>        Toggle command line editing, and context sensitive command
                 and file completion.  This is automatically enabled if input
                 is from a terminal, and disabled otherwise.

                 per filename.

     <B>form</B> <I>format</I>
                 Set the file transfer <B>form</B> to <I>format</I>.  The default format is
                 ``file''.

     <B>ftp</B> <I>host</I> [<I>port</I>]
                 A synonym for <B>open</B>.

     <B>gate</B> [<I>host</I> [<I>port</I>]]
                 Toggle gate-ftp mode, which used to connect through the TIS
                 FWTK and Gauntlet ftp proxies.  This will not be permitted if
                 the gate-ftp server hasn't been set (either explicitly by the
                 user, or from the FTPSERVER environment variable).  If <I>host</I>
                 is given, then gate-ftp mode will be enabled, and the gate-
                 ftp server will be set to <I>host</I>.  If <I>port</I> is also given, that
                 will be used as the port to connect to on the gate-ftp
                 server.

     <B>get</B> <I>remote-file</I> [<I>local-file</I>]
                 Retrieve the <I>remote-file</I> and store it on the local machine.
                 If the local file name is not specified, it is given the same
                 name it has on the remote machine, subject to alteration by
                 the current <B>case</B>, <B>ntrans</B>, and <B>nmap</B> settings.  The current
                 settings for <B>type</B>, <B>form</B>, <B>mode</B>, and <B>structure</B> are used while
                 transferring the file.

     <B>glob</B>        Toggle filename expansion for <B>mdelete</B>, <B>mget</B> and <B>mput</B>.  If
                 globbing is turned off with <B>glob</B>, the file name arguments are
                 taken literally and not expanded.  Globbing for <B>mput</B> is done
                 as in <B>csh(1)</B>.  For <B>mdelete</B> and <B>mget</B>, each remote file name is
                 expanded separately on the remote machine and the lists are
                 not merged.  Expansion of a directory name is likely to be
                 different from expansion of the name of an ordinary file: the
                 exact result depends on the foreign operating system and ftp
                 server, and can be previewed by doing `mls remote-files -'
                 Note: <B>mget</B> and <B>mput</B> are not meant to transfer entire direc­
                 tory subtrees of files.  That can be done by transferring a
                 <B>tar(1)</B> archive of the subtree (in binary mode).

     <B>hash</B> [<I>size</I>]
                 Toggle hash-sign (``#'') printing for each data block trans­
                 ferred.  The size of a data block defaults to 1024 bytes.
                 This can be changed by specifying <I>size</I> in bytes.  Enabling
                 <B>hash</B> disables <B>progress</B>.

     <B>help</B> [<I>command</I>]
                 Print an informative message about the meaning of <I>command</I>.
                 If no argument is given, <B>ftp</B> prints a list of the known com­
                 mands.

     <B>idle</B> [<I>seconds</I>]
                 <B>pager</B> option.

     <B>lpwd</B>        Print the working directory on the local machine.

     <B>ls</B> [<I>remote-path</I> [<I>local-file</I>]]
                 A synonym for <B>dir</B>.

     <B>macdef</B> <I>macro-name</I>
                 Define a macro.  Subsequent lines are stored as the macro
                 <I>macro-name</I>; a null line (consecutive newline characters in a
                 file or carriage returns from the terminal) terminates macro
                 input mode.  There is a limit of 16 macros and 4096 total
                 characters in all defined macros.  Macros remain defined
                 until a <B>close</B> command is executed.  The macro processor
                 interprets `$' and `\' as special characters.  A `$' followed
                 by a number (or numbers) is replaced by the corresponding
                 argument on the macro invocation command line.  A `$' fol­
                 lowed by an `i' signals that macro processor that the execut­
                 ing macro is to be looped.  On the first pass `$i' is
                 replaced by the first argument on the macro invocation com­
                 mand line, on the second pass it is replaced by the second
                 argument, and so on.  A `\' followed by any character is
                 replaced by that character.  Use the `\' to prevent special
                 treatment of the `$'.

     <B>mdelete</B> [<I>remote-files</I>]
                 Delete the <I>remote-files</I> on the remote machine.

     <B>mdir</B> <I>remote-files</I> <I>local-file</I>
                 Like <B>dir</B>, except multiple remote files may be specified.  If
                 interactive prompting is on, <B>ftp</B> will prompt the user to ver­
                 ify that the last argument is indeed the target local file
                 for receiving <B>mdir</B> output.

     <B>mget</B> <I>remote-files</I>
                 Expand the <I>remote-files</I> on the remote machine and do a <B>get</B>
                 for each file name thus produced.  See <B>glob</B> for details on
                 the filename expansion.  Resulting file names will then be
                 processed according to <B>case</B>, <B>ntrans</B>, and <B>nmap</B> settings.
                 Files are transferred into the local working directory, which
                 can be changed with `lcd directory'; new local directories
                 can be created with `! mkdir directory'.

     <B>mkdir</B> <I>directory-name</I>
                 Make a directory on the remote machine.

     <B>mls</B> <I>remote-files</I> <I>local-file</I>
                 Like <B>ls</B>, except multiple remote files may be specified, and
                 the <I>local-file</I> must be specified.  If interactive prompting
                 is on, <B>ftp</B> will prompt the user to verify that the last argu­
                 ment is indeed the target local file for receiving <B>mls</B> out­
                 put.
                 Set the file transfer <B>mode</B> to <I>mode-name</I>.  The default mode is
                 ``stream'' mode.

     <B>modtime</B> <I>remote-file</I>
                 Show the last modification time of the file on the remote
                 machine.

     <B>more</B> <I>file</I>   A synonym for <B>page</B>.

     <B>mput</B> <I>local-files</I>
                 Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as argu­
                 ments and do a <B>put</B> for each file in the resulting list.  See
                 <B>glob</B> for details of filename expansion.  Resulting file names
                 will then be processed according to <B>ntrans</B> and <B>nmap</B> settings.

     <B>msend</B> <I>local-files</I>
                 A synonym for <B>mput</B>.

     <B>newer</B> <I>remote-file</I> [<I>local-file</I>]
                 Get the file only if the modification time of the remote file
                 is more recent that the file on the current system.  If the
                 file does not exist on the current system, the remote file is
                 considered <B>newer</B>.  Otherwise, this command is identical to
                 <I>get</I>.

     <B>nlist</B> [<I>remote-path</I> [<I>local-file</I>]]
                 A synonym for <B>ls</B>.

     <B>nmap</B> [<I>inpattern</I> <I>outpattern</I>]
                 Set or unset the filename mapping mechanism.  If no arguments
                 are specified, the filename mapping mechanism is unset.  If
                 arguments are specified, remote filenames are mapped during
                 <B>mput</B> commands and <B>put</B> commands issued without a specified
                 remote target filename.  If arguments are specified, local
                 filenames are mapped during <B>mget</B> commands and <B>get</B> commands
                 issued without a specified local target filename.  This com­
                 mand is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote computer
                 with different file naming conventions or practices.  The
                 mapping follows the pattern set by <I>inpattern</I> and <I>outpattern</I>.
                 [<I>Inpattern</I>] is a template for incoming filenames (which may
                 have already been processed according to the <B>ntrans</B> and <B>case</B>
                 settings).  Variable templating is accomplished by including
                 the sequences `$1', `$2', ..., `$9' in <I>inpattern</I>.  Use `\' to
                 prevent this special treatment of the `$' character.  All
                 other characters are treated literally, and are used to
                 determine the <B>nmap</B> [<I>inpattern</I>] variable values.  For example,
                 given <I>inpattern</I> $1.$2 and the remote file name "mydata.data",
                 $1 would have the value "mydata", and $2 would have the value
                 "data".  The <I>outpattern</I> determines the resulting mapped file­
                 name.  The sequences `$1', `$2', ...., `$9' are replaced by
                 any value resulting from the <I>inpattern</I> template.  The
                 sequence `$0' is replace by the original filename.  Addition­

     <B>ntrans</B> [<I>inchars</I> [<I>outchars</I>]]
                 Set or unset the filename character translation mechanism.
                 If no arguments are specified, the filename character trans­
                 lation mechanism is unset.  If arguments are specified, char­
                 acters in remote filenames are translated during <B>mput</B> com­
                 mands and <B>put</B> commands issued without a specified remote tar­
                 get filename.  If arguments are specified, characters in
                 local filenames are translated during <B>mget</B> commands and <B>get</B>
                 commands issued without a specified local target filename.
                 This command is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote
                 computer with different file naming conventions or practices.
                 Characters in a filename matching a character in <I>inchars</I> are
                 replaced with the corresponding character in <I>outchars</I>.  If
                 the character's position in <I>inchars</I> is longer than the length
                 of <I>outchars</I>, the character is deleted from the file name.

     <B>open</B> <I>host</I> [<I>port</I>]
                 Establish a connection to the specified <I>host</I> FTP server.  An
                 optional port number may be supplied, in which case, <B>ftp</B> will
                 attempt to contact an FTP server at that port.  If the
                 <B>auto-login</B> option is on (default), <B>ftp</B> will also attempt to
                 automatically log the user in to the FTP server (see below).

     <B>page</B> <I>file</I>   Retrieve <B>file</B> and display with the program specified by the
                 <B>set</B> <B>pager</B> option.

     <B>passive</B> [<B>auto</B>]
                 Toggle passive mode (if no arguments are given).  If <B>auto</B> is
                 given, act as if FTPMODE is set to `auto'.  If passive mode
                 is turned on (default), <B>ftp</B> will send a PASV command for all
                 data connections instead of a PORT command.  The PASV command
                 requests that the remote server open a port for the data con­
                 nection and return the address of that port.  The remote
                 server listens on that port and the client connects to it.
                 When using the more traditional PORT command, the client lis­
                 tens on a port and sends that address to the remote server,
                 who connects back to it.  Passive mode is useful when using
                 <B>ftp</B> through a gateway router or host that controls the direc­
                 tionality of traffic.  (Note that though FTP servers are
                 required to support the PASV command by RFC 1123, some do
                 not.)

     <B>pdir</B> [<I>remote-path</I>]
                 Perform <B>dir</B> [<I>remote-path</I>], and display the result with the
                 program specified by the <B>set</B> <B>pager</B> option.

     <B>pls</B> [<I>remote-path</I>]
                 Perform <B>ls</B> [<I>remote-path</I>], and display the result with the
                 program specified by the <B>set</B> <B>pager</B> option.

     <B>pmlsd</B> [<I>remote-path</I>]
                 Perform <B>mlsd</B> [<I>remote-path</I>], and display the result with the
                 and any <B>mdelete</B> will delete all files.

                 When prompting is on, the following commands are available at
                 a prompt:

                       <B>a</B>   Answer `yes' to the current file, and automatically
                           answer `yes' to any remaining files for the current
                           command.

                       <B>n</B>   Answer `no', and do not transfer the file.

                       <B>p</B>   Answer `yes' to the current file, and turn off
                           prompt mode (as is ``prompt off'' had been given).

                       <B>q</B>   Terminate the current operation.

                       <B>y</B>   Answer `yes', and transfer the file.

                       ?   Display a help message.

                 Any other reponse will answer `yes' to the current file.

     <B>proxy</B> <I>ftp-command</I>
                 Execute an ftp command on a secondary control connection.
                 This command allows simultaneous connection to two remote FTP
                 servers for transferring files between the two servers.  The
                 first <B>proxy</B> command should be an <B>open</B>, to establish the sec­
                 ondary control connection.  Enter the command "proxy ?" to
                 see other FTP commands executable on the secondary connec­
                 tion.  The following commands behave differently when pref­
                 aced by <B>proxy</B>: <B>open</B> will not define new macros during the
                 auto-login process, <B>close</B> will not erase existing macro defi­
                 nitions, <B>get</B> and <B>mget</B> transfer files from the host on the
                 primary control connection to the host on the secondary con­
                 trol connection, and <B>put</B>, <B>mput</B>, and <B>append</B> transfer files
                 from the host on the secondary control connection to the host
                 on the primary control connection.  Third party file trans­
                 fers depend upon support of the FTP protocol PASV command by
                 the server on the secondary control connection.

     <B>put</B> <I>local-file</I> [<I>remote-file</I>]
                 Store a local file on the remote machine.  If <I>remote-file</I> is
                 left unspecified, the local file name is used after process­
                 ing according to any <B>ntrans</B> or <B>nmap</B> settings in naming the
                 remote file.  File transfer uses the current settings for
                 <B>type</B>, <B>format</B>, <B>mode</B>, and <B>structure</B>.

     <B>pwd</B>         Print the name of the current working directory on the remote
                 machine.

     <B>quit</B>        A synonym for <B>bye</B>.

                 (default: 1024) each time a given signal is received:

                       SIGUSR1  Increment <I>maximum</I> by <I>increment</I> bytes.

                       SIGUSR2  Decrement <I>maximum</I> by <I>increment</I> bytes.  The
                                result must be a positive number.

                 If <I>maximum</I> is not supplied, the current throttle rates are
                 displayed.

                 Note: <B>rate</B> is not yet implemented for ascii mode transfers.

     <B>rcvbuf</B> <I>size</I>
                 Set the size of the socket receive buffer to <I>size</I>.

     <B>recv</B> <I>remote-file</I> [<I>local-file</I>]
                 A synonym for <B>get</B>.

     <B>reget</B> <I>remote-file</I> [<I>local-file</I>]
                 <B>reget</B> acts like <B>get</B>, except that if <I>local-file</I> exists and is
                 smaller than <I>remote-file</I>, <I>local-file</I> is presumed to be a par­
                 tially transferred copy of <I>remote-file</I> and the transfer is
                 continued from the apparent point of failure.  This command
                 is useful when transferring very large files over networks
                 that are prone to dropping connections.

     <B>remopts</B> <I>command</I> [<I>command-options</I>]
                 Set options on the remote FTP server for <I>command</I> to
                 <I>command-options</I> (whose absence is handled on a command-spe­
                 cific basis).  Remote FTP commands known to support options
                 include: `MLST' (used for MLSD and MLST).

     <B>rename</B> [<I>from</I> [<I>to</I>]]
                 Rename the file <I>from</I> on the remote machine, to the file <I>to</I>.

     <B>reset</B>       Clear reply queue.  This command re-synchronizes com­
                 mand/reply sequencing with the remote FTP server.  Resynchro­
                 nization may be necessary following a violation of the FTP
                 protocol by the remote server.

     <B>restart</B> <I>marker</I>
                 Restart the immediately following <B>get</B> or <B>put</B> at the indicated
                 <I>marker</I>.  On UNIX systems, marker is usually a byte offset
                 into the file.

     <B>rhelp</B> [<I>command-name</I>]
                 Request help from the remote FTP server.  If a <I>command-name</I>
                 is specified it is supplied to the server as well.

     <B>rmdir</B> <I>directory-name</I>
                 Delete a directory on the remote machine.

                 below).  The default value is off.

     <B>send</B> <I>local-file</I> [<I>remote-file</I>]
                 A synonym for <B>put</B>.

     <B>sendport</B>    Toggle the use of PORT commands.  By default, <B>ftp</B> will
                 attempt to use a PORT command when establishing a connection
                 for each data transfer.  The use of PORT commands can prevent
                 delays when performing multiple file transfers.  If the PORT
                 command fails, <B>ftp</B> will use the default data port.  When the
                 use of PORT commands is disabled, no attempt will be made to
                 use PORT commands for each data transfer.  This is useful for
                 certain FTP implementations which do ignore PORT commands
                 but, incorrectly, indicate they've been accepted.

     <B>set</B> [<I>option</I> <I>value</I>]
                 Set <I>option</I> to <I>value</I>.  If <I>option</I> and <I>value</I> are not given, dis­
                 play all of the options and their values.  The currently sup­
                 ported options are:

                       anonpass    Defaults to $FTPANONPASS

                       ftp_proxy   Defaults to $ftp_proxy.

                       http_proxy  Defaults to $http_proxy.

                       no_proxy    Defaults to $no_proxy.

                       pager       Defaults to $PAGER.

                       prompt      Defaults to $FTPPROMPT.

                       rprompt     Defaults to $FTPRPROMPT.

     <B>size</B> <I>remote-file</I>
                 Return size of <I>remote-file</I> on remote machine.

     <B>sndbuf</B> <I>size</I>
                 Set the size of the socket send buffer to <I>size</I>.

     <B>site</B> <I>arg1</I> <I>arg2</I> <I>...</I>
                 The arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to the remote FTP
                 server as a SITE command.

     <B>status</B>      Show the current status of <B>ftp</B>.

     <B>struct</B> <I>struct-name</I>
                 Set the file transfer <I>structure</I> to <I>struct-name</I>.  By default
                 ``stream'' structure is used.

     <B>sunique</B>     Toggle storing of files on remote machine under unique file
                 names.  The remote FTP server must support FTP protocol STOU
                 Set the file transfer <B>type</B> to <I>type-name</I>.  If no type is spec­
                 ified, the current type is printed.  The default type is net­
                 work ASCII.

     <B>umask</B> [<I>newmask</I>]
                 Set the default umask on the remote server to <I>newmask</I>.  If
                 <I>newmask</I> is omitted, the current umask is printed.

     <B>unset</B> <I>option</I>
                 Unset <I>option</I>.  Refer to <B>set</B> for more information.

     <B>usage</B> <I>command</I>
                 Print the usage message for <I>command</I>.

     <B>user</B> <I>user-name</I> [<I>password</I> [<I>account</I>]]
                 Identify yourself to the remote FTP server.  If the <I>password</I>
                 is not specified and the server requires it, <B>ftp</B> will prompt
                 the user for it (after disabling local echo).  If an <I>account</I>
                 field is not specified, and the FTP server requires it, the
                 user will be prompted for it.  If an <I>account</I> field is speci­
                 fied, an account command will be relayed to the remote server
                 after the login sequence is completed if the remote server
                 did not require it for logging in.  Unless <B>ftp</B> is invoked
                 with ``auto-login'' disabled, this process is done automati­
                 cally on initial connection to the FTP server.

     <B>verbose</B>     Toggle verbose mode.  In verbose mode, all responses from the
                 FTP server are displayed to the user.  In addition, if ver­
                 bose is on, when a file transfer completes, statistics
                 regarding the efficiency of the transfer are reported.  By
                 default, verbose is on.

     <B>xferbuf</B> <I>size</I>
                 Set the size of the socket send and receive buffers to <I>size</I>.

     ? [<I>command</I>]
                 A synonym for <B>help</B>.

     Command arguments which have embedded spaces may be quoted with quote `"'
     marks.

     Commands which toggle settings can take an explicit <B>on</B> or <B>off</B> argument to
     force the setting appropriately.

     Commands which take a byte count as an argument (e.g., <B>hash</B>, <B>rate</B>, and
     <B>xferbuf</B>) support an optional suffix on the argument which changes the
     interpretation of the argument.  Supported suffixes are:
           b    Causes no modification. (Optional)
           k    Kilo; multiply the argument by 1024
           m    Mega; multiply the argument by 1048576
           g    Giga; multiply the argument by 1073741824


           If <I>path</I> contains a glob character and globbing is enabled, (see
           <B>glob</B>), then the equivalent of `mget path' is performed.

           If the directory component of <I>path</I> contains no globbing characters,
           it is stored locally with the name basename (see <B>basename(1)</B>) of
           <B>path</B>, in the current directory.  Otherwise, the full remote name is
           used as the local name, relative to the local root directory.

     ftp://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/path[/][;type=X]
           An FTP URL, retrieved using the FTP protocol if <B>set</B> <B>ftp_proxy</B> isn't
           defined.  Otherwise, transfer the URL using HTTP via the proxy
           defined in <B>set</B> <B>ftp_proxy</B>.  If <B>set</B> <B>ftp_proxy</B> isn't defined and <I>user</I>
           is given, login as <I>user</I>.  In this case, use <I>password</I> if supplied,
           otherwise prompt the user for one.

           In order to be compliant with <B>RFC</B> <B>1738</B>, <B>ftp</B> strips the leading `/'
           from <I>path</I>, resulting in a transfer relative from the default login
           directory of the user.  If the <I>/</I> directory is required, use a lead­
           ing path of ``%2F''.  If a user's home directory is required (and
           the remote server supports the syntax), use a leading path of
           ``%7Euser/''.  For example, to retrieve <I>/etc/motd</I> from `localhost'
           as the user `myname' with the password `mypass', use
           ``ftp://myname:mypass@localhost/%2fetc/motd''

           If a suffix of `;type=A' or `;type=I' is supplied, then the trans­
           fer type will take place as ascii or binary (respectively).  The
           default transfer type is binary.

     http://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/path
           An HTTP URL, retrieved using the HTTP protocol.  If <B>set</B> <B>http_proxy</B>
           is defined, it is used as a URL to an HTTP proxy server.  If HTTP
           authorisation is required to retrieve <I>path</I>, and `user' (and option­
           ally `password') is in the URL, use them for the first attempt to
           authenticate.

     file:///path
           A local URL, copied from <I>/path</I>.

     Unless noted otherwise above, and <B>-o</B> <I>output</I> is not given, the file is
     stored in the current directory as the <B>basename(1)</B> of <I>path</I>.

     If a classic format or an FTP URL format has a trailing `/' or an empty
     <I>path</I> component, then <B>ftp</B> will connect to the site and <B>cd</B> to the directory
     given as the path, and leave the user in interactive mode ready for fur­
     ther input.  This will not work if <B>set</B> <B>ftp_proxy</B> is being used.

     Direct HTTP transfers use HTTP 1.1.  Proxied FTP and HTTP transfers use
     HTTP 1.0.

     If <B>-R</B> is given, all auto-fetches that don't go via the FTP or HTTP prox­
     ies will be restarted.  For FTP, this is implemented by using <B>reget</B>
     will be halted by sending an FTP protocol ABOR command to the remote
     server, and discarding any further data received.  The speed at which
     this is accomplished depends upon the remote server's support for ABOR
     processing.  If the remote server does not support the ABOR command, the
     prompt will not appear until the remote server has completed sending the
     requested file.

     If the terminal interrupt key sequence is used whilst <B>ftp</B> is awaiting a
     reply from the remote server for the ABOR processing, then the connection
     will be closed.  This is different from the traditional behaviour (which
     ignores the terminal interrupt during this phase), but is considered more
     useful.


</PRE>
<H2>FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS</H2><PRE>
     Files specified as arguments to <B>ftp</B> commands are processed according to
     the following rules.

     1.   If the file name `<B>-</B>' is specified, the <I>stdin</I> (for reading) or <I>stdout</I>
          (for writing) is used.

     2.   If the first character of the file name is `|', the remainder of the
          argument is interpreted as a shell command.  <B>ftp</B> then forks a shell,
          using <B>popen(3)</B> with the argument supplied, and reads (writes) from
          the stdout (stdin).  If the shell command includes spaces, the argu­
          ment must be quoted; e.g.  ``"| ls -lt"''.  A particularly useful
          example of this mechanism is: ``dir "" |more''.

     3.   Failing the above checks, if ``globbing'' is enabled, local file
          names are expanded according to the rules used in the <B>csh(1)</B>; c.f.
          the <B>glob</B> command.  If the <B>ftp</B> command expects a single local file
          (e.g.  <B>put</B>), only the first filename generated by the "globbing"
          operation is used.

     4.   For <B>mget</B> commands and <B>get</B> commands with unspecified local file
          names, the local filename is the remote filename, which may be
          altered by a <B>case</B>, <B>ntrans</B>, or <B>nmap</B> setting.  The resulting filename
          may then be altered if <B>runique</B> is on.

     5.   For <B>mput</B> commands and <B>put</B> commands with unspecified remote file
          names, the remote filename is the local filename, which may be
          altered by a <B>ntrans</B> or <B>nmap</B> setting.  The resulting filename may
          then be altered by the remote server if <B>sunique</B> is on.


</PRE>
<H2>FILE TRANSFER PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
     The FTP specification specifies many parameters which may affect a file
     transfer.  The <B>type</B> may be one of ``ascii'', ``image'' (binary),
     ``ebcdic'', and ``local byte size'' (for PDP-10's and PDP-20's mostly).
     <B>ftp</B> supports the ascii and image types of file transfer, plus local byte
     size 8 for <B>tenex</B> mode transfers.

     <B>ftp</B> supports only the default values for the remaining file transfer
     parameters: <B>mode</B>, <B>form</B>, and <B>struct</B>.

     <B>default</B>   This is the same as <B>machine</B> <I>name</I> except that <B>default</B> matches
               any name.  There can be only one <B>default</B> token, and it must be
               after all <B>machine</B> tokens.  This is normally used as:

                     default login anonymous password user@site

               thereby giving the user an automatic anonymous FTP login to
               machines not specified in <I>.netrc</I>.  This can be overridden by
               using the <B>-n</B> flag to disable auto-login.

     <B>login</B> <I>name</I>
               Identify a user on the remote machine.  If this token is pre­
               sent, the auto-login process will initiate a login using the
               specified <I>name</I>.

     <B>password</B> <I>string</I>
               Supply a password.  If this token is present, the auto-login
               process will supply the specified string if the remote server
               requires a password as part of the login process.  Note that if
               this token is present in the <I>.netrc</I> file for any user other
               than <I>anonymous</I>, <B>ftp</B> will abort the auto-login process if the
               <I>.netrc</I> is readable by anyone besides the user.

     <B>account</B> <I>string</I>
               Supply an additional account password.  If this token is pre­
               sent, the auto-login process will supply the specified string
               if the remote server requires an additional account password,
               or the auto-login process will initiate an ACCT command if it
               does not.

     <B>macdef</B> <I>name</I>
               Define a macro.  This token functions like the <B>ftp</B> <B>macdef</B> com­
               mand functions.  A macro is defined with the specified name;
               its contents begin with the next <I>.netrc</I> line and continue until
               a blank line (consecutive new-line characters) is encountered.
               If a macro named <B>init</B> is defined, it is automatically executed
               as the last step in the auto-login process.


</PRE>
<H2>COMMAND LINE EDITING</H2><PRE>
     <B>ftp</B> supports interactive command line editing, via the <B>editline(3)</B>
     library.  It is enabled with the <B>edit</B> command, and is enabled by default
     if input is from a tty.  Previous lines can be recalled and edited with
     the arrow keys, and other GNU Emacs-style editing keys may be used as
     well.

     The <B>editline(3)</B> library is configured with a <I>.editrc</I> file - refer to
     <B>editrc(5)</B> for more information.

     An extra key binding is available to <B>ftp</B> to provide context sensitive
     command and filename completion (including remote file completion).  To
     use this, bind a key to the <B>editline(3)</B> command <B>ftp-complete</B>.  By
                The trailing component of the current remote working direc­
                tory, or <I>n</I> trailing components if a digit <I>n</I> is given.  If <I>n</I>
                begins with `0', the number of skipped components precede the
                trailing component(s) in the format ``/<I>&lt;skipped&gt;</I>trailing''
                (for `%c') or ``...trailing'' (for `%.').

           %M   The remote host name.

           %m   The remote host name, up to the first `.'.

           %n   The remote user name.

           %%   A single `%'.

<H2>HISTORY</H2><PRE>
     The <B>ftp</B> command appeared in 4.2BSD.

     Various features such as command line editing, context sensitive command
     and file completion, dynamic progress bar, automatic fetching of files
     and URLs, modification time preservation, transfer rate throttling, con­
     figurable command line prompt, and other enhancements over the standard
     BSD <B>ftp</B> were implemented in NetBSD 1.3 and later releases by Luke Mewburn
     &lt;lukem@netbsd.org&gt;.

     IPv6 support was added by the WIDE/KAME project (but may not be present
     in all non-NetBSD versions of this program, depending if the operating
     system supports IPv6 in a similar manner to KAME).


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     Correct execution of many commands depends upon proper behavior by the
     remote server.

     An error in the treatment of carriage returns in the 4.2BSD ascii-mode
     transfer code has been corrected.  This correction may result in incor­
     rect transfers of binary files to and from 4.2BSD servers using the ascii
     type.  Avoid this problem by using the binary image type.

     <B>ftp</B> assumes that all IPv4 mapped addresses (IPv6 addresses with a form
     like ::ffff:10.1.1.1) indicate IPv4 destinations which can be handled by
     AF_INET sockets.  However, in certain IPv6 network configurations, this
     assumption is not true.  In such an environment, IPv4 mapped addresses
     must be passed to AF_INET6 sockets directly.  For example, if your site
     uses a SIIT translator for IPv6-to-IPv4 translation, <B>ftp</B> is unable to
     support your configuration.
