<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>killall</B> sends a signal to all processes running any of the
       specified  commands.  If  no  signal  name  is  specified,
       SIGTERM is sent.

       Signals can be specified either by name (e.g. <B>-HUP</B>) or  by
       number (e.g. <B>-1</B>).

       If  the  command name contains a slash (<B>/</B>), processes exe­
       cuting that particular file will be selected for  killing,
       independent of their name.

       <B>killall</B> returns a zero return code if at least one process
       has been killed for each ilisted command. <B>killall</B>  returns
       zero otherwise.

       A  <B>killall</B>  process never kills itself (but may kill other
       <B>killall</B> processes).

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-e</B>, <B>--exact</B>
              Require an exact match for very long  names.  If  a
              command name is longer than 15 characters, the full
              name may be unavailable (i.e. it is  swapped  out).
              In  this  case,  <B>killall</B>  will kill everything that
              matches within the first 15  characters.  With  <B>-e</B>,
              such entries are skipped.  <B>killall</B> prints a message
              for each skipped entry if <B>-v</B> is specified in  addi­
              tion to <B>-e</B>,

       <B>-g</B>, <B>--process-group</B>
              Kill   the  process  group  to  which  the  process
              belongs. The kill signal  is  only  sent  once  per
              group,  even if multiple processes belonging to the
              same process group were found.

       <B>-i</B>, <B>--interactive</B>
              Interactively ask for confirmation before  killing.

       <B>-l</B>, <B>--list</B>
              List all known signal names.

       <B>-q</B>, <B>--quiet</B>
              Do not complain if no processes were killed.

       <B>-S</B>     (Flask only) Specify SID: kill only processes  with
              given  SID.  Mutually  exclusive  with <B>-c</B> argument.
              Must precede other arguments on command line.

       <B>-c</B>     (Flask only) Specify security  context:  kill  only
              processes  with  given  security context.  Mutually
              exclusive with <B>-s</B>.  Must precede other arguments on
              the command line.

<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>
       /proc     location of the proc file system

<H2>KNOWN BUGS</H2><PRE>
       Killing  by  file only works for executables that are kept
       open during execution, i.e. impure  executables  can't  be
       killed this way.

       Be  warned  that  typing  <B>killall</B>  <I>name</I>  may  not have the
       desired effect on non-Linux systems, especially when  done
       by a privileged user.

       <B>killall</B>  <B>-w</B>  doesn't detect if a process disappears and is
       replaced by a new process with the same PID between scans.
