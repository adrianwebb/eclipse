<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This  command outputs the length of an iso9660 file system
       that is contained in given file. That file may be a normal
       file or a block device (e.g. /dev/hdd or /dev/sr0). In the
       absence of any switches (or errors)  it  will  output  the
       size  of the iso9660 file system in bytes. This can now be
       a large number (&gt; > 4 GB).

       -x     output in humanly readable form the block count and
              the  block size. Output uses the term "sectors" for
              "blocks".

       -d &lt;num&gt;
              only has affect when "-x" is not given. The  number
              output  (if  no errors) is the iso9660 file size in
              bytes divided by &lt;num&gt;. So if &lt;num&gt;  is  the  block
              size  then  the  output  number  will  be the block
              count.

       The size of the file (or block device) holding  a  iso9660
       file  system can be marginally larger than the actual size
       of the iso9660 file system. One reason for this is that cd
       writers are allowed to add "run out" sectors at the end of
       a iso9660 image.
