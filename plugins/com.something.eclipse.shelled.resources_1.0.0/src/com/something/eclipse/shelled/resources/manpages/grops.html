<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>grops</B>  translates  the  output of GNU <B>troff</B> to PostScript.
       Normally <B>grops</B> should be invoked by using the  groff  com­
       mand  with  a <B>-Tps</B> option.  (Actually, this is the default
       for groff.)  If no files are given, <B>grops</B>  will  read  the
       standard  input.  A filename of <B>-</B> will also cause <B>grops</B> to
       read the standard input.  PostScript output is written  to
       the  standard  output.  When <B>grops</B> is run by <B>groff</B> options
       can be passed to <B>grops</B> using the <B>groff</B> <B>-P</B> option.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-b</B><I>n</I>    Workaround broken spoolers  and  previewers.   Nor­
              mally <B>grops</B> produces output that conforms the Docu­
              ment Structuring Conventions version 3.0.  Unfortu­
              nately  some  spoolers  and previewers can't handle
              such output.  The value of <I>n</I>  controls  what  <B>grops</B>
              does  to its output acceptable to such programs.  A
              value of 0 will  cause  grops  not  to  employ  any
              workarounds.   Add 1 if no <B>%%BeginDocumentSetup</B> and
              <B>%%EndDocumentSetup</B> comments  should  be  generated;
              this  is  needed  for  early versions of TranScript
              that get confused by anything between the <B>%%EndPro­</B>
              <B>log</B> comment and the first <B>%%Page</B> comment.  Add 2 if
              lines in included files beginning with  <B>%!</B>   should
              be  stripped out; this is needed for Sun's pageview
              previewer.  Add 4 if <B>%%Page</B>, <B>%%Trailer</B>  and  <B>%%End­</B>
              <B>Prolog</B>  comments should be stripped out of included
              files; this  is  needed  for  spoolers  that  don't
              understand  the  <B>%%BeginDocument</B>  and <B>%%EndDocument</B>
              comments.   Add  8  if  the  first  line   of   the
              PostScript  output  should be <B>%!PS-Adobe-2.0</B> rather
              than <B>%!PS-Adobe-3.0</B>;  this  is  needed  when  using
              Sun's  Newsprint  with a printer that requires page
              reversal.  The default value can be specified by a

                     <B>broken</B> <I>n</I>

              command in the DESC file.   Otherwise  the  default
              value is 0.

       <B>-c</B><I>n</I>    Print <I>n</I> copies of each page.

       <B>-g</B>     Guess  the  page length.  This generates PostScript
              code that guesses the page length.  The guess  will
              be correct only if the imageable area is vertically
              the prologue instead of the default  prologue  file
              <B>prologue</B>.   This  option  overrides the environment
              variable GROPS_PROLOGUE.

       <B>-w</B><I>n</I>    Lines should be drawn using a thickness of <I>n</I>  thou­
              sandths of an em.

       <B>-v</B>     Print the version number.

<H2>USAGE</H2><PRE>
       There  are  styles  called <B>R</B>, <B>I</B>, <B>B</B>, and <B>BI</B> mounted at font
       positions 1 to 4.  The fonts are grouped into families  <B>A</B>,
       <B>BM</B>,  <B>C</B>,  <B>H</B>, <B>HN</B>, <B>N</B>, <B>P</B> and <B>T</B> having members in each of these
       styles:

       <B>AR</B>     AvantGarde-Book

       <B>AI</B>     AvantGarde-BookOblique

       <B>AB</B>     AvantGarde-Demi

       <B>ABI</B>    AvantGarde-DemiOblique

       <B>BMR</B>    Bookman-Light

       <B>BMI</B>    Bookman-LightItalic

       <B>BMB</B>    Bookman-Demi

       <B>BMBI</B>   Bookman-DemiItalic

       <B>CR</B>     Courier

       <B>CI</B>     Courier-Oblique

       <B>CB</B>     Courier-Bold

       <B>CBI</B>    Courier-BoldOblique

       <B>HR</B>     Helvetica

       <B>HI</B>     Helvetica-Oblique

       <B>HB</B>     Helvetica-Bold

       <B>HBI</B>    Helvetica-BoldOblique

       <B>HNR</B>    Helvetica-Narrow

       <B>HNI</B>    Helvetica-Narrow-Oblique

       <B>HNB</B>    Helvetica-Narrow-Bold

       <B>PB</B>     Palatino-Bold

       <B>PBI</B>    Palatino-BoldItalic

       <B>TR</B>     Times-Roman

       <B>TI</B>     Times-Italic

       <B>TB</B>     Times-Bold

       <B>TBI</B>    Times-BoldItalic

       There is also the following font which is not a member  of
       a family:

       <B>ZCMI</B>   ZapfChancery-MediumItalic

       There  are  also some special fonts called <B>SS</B> and <B>S</B>.  Zapf
       Dingbats is available as <B>ZD</B>  and  a  reversed  version  of
       ZapfDingbats (with symbols pointing in the opposite direc­
       tion) is available as <B>ZDR</B>; most characters in these  fonts
       are unnamed and must be accessed using <B>\N</B>.

       <B>grops</B> understands various X commands produced using the <B>\X</B>
       escape sequence; <B>grops</B> will only interpret  commands  that
       begin with a <B>ps:</B> tag.

       <B>\X'ps:</B> <B>exec</B> <I>code</I><B>'</B>
              This  executes the arbitrary PostScript commands in
              <I>code</I>.  The PostScript currentpoint will be  set  to
              the  position  of  the  <B>\X</B> command before executing
              <I>code</I>.  The origin will be at the top left corner of
              the  page, and y coordinates will increase down the
              page.  A procedure <B>u</B> will be defined that  converts
              groff  units  to  the  coordinate system in effect.
              For example,

                     <B>.nr</B> <B>x</B> <B>1i</B>
                     <B>\X'ps:</B> <B>exec</B> <B>\nx</B> <B>u</B> <B>0</B> <B>rlineto</B> <B>stroke'</B>

              will draw a horizontal line one  inch  long.   <I>code</I>
              may  make  changes  to  the graphics state, but any
              changes will persist only to the end of  the  page.
              A  dictionary  containing the definitions specified
              by the <B>def</B> and <B>mdef</B> will be on top of  the  dictio­
              nary  stack.  If your code adds definitions to this
              dictionary, you  should  allocate  space  for  them
              using  <B>\X'ps</B> <B>mdef</B> <I>n</I><B>'</B>.  Any definitions will persist
              only until the end of the page.  If you use the  <B>\Y</B>
              escape  sequence  with  an  argument  that  names a
              macro, <I>code</I> can extend over  multiple  lines.   For
              This is the same as the <B>exec</B>  command  except  that
              the PostScript code is read from file <I>name</I>.

       <B>\X'ps:</B> <B>def</B> <I>code</I><B>'</B>
              Place  a PostScript definition contained in <I>code</I> in
              the prologue.  There should be at most one  defini­
              tion per <B>\X</B> command.  Long definitions can be split
              over several <B>\X</B> commands; all  the  <I>code</I>  arguments
              are  simply  joined together separated by newlines.
              The definitions are placed in a dictionary which is
              automatically  pushed  on the dictionary stack when
              an <B>exec</B> command is executed.  If  you  use  the  <B>\Y</B>
              escape  sequence  with  an  argument  that  names a
              macro, <I>code</I> can extend over multiple lines.

       <B>\X'ps:</B> <B>mdef</B> <I>n</I> <I>code</I><B>'</B>
              Like <B>def</B>, except that <I>code</I> may contain up to <I>n</I> def­
              initions.  <B>grops</B> needs to know how many definitions
              <I>code</I> contains so that it can  create  an  appropri­
              ately  sized PostScript dictionary to contain them.

       <B>\X'ps:</B> <B>import</B> <I>file</I> <I>llx</I> <I>lly</I> <I>urx</I> <I>ury</I> <I>width</I> [ <I>height</I> ]<B>'</B>
              Import a PostScript graphic from <I>file</I>.   The  argu­
              ments  <I>llx</I>, <I>lly</I>, <I>urx</I>, and <I>ury</I> give the bounding box
              of the graphic in the default PostScript coordinate
              system;  they  should  all be integers; <I>llx</I> and <I>lly</I>
              are the x and y coordinates of the lower left  cor­
              ner  of  the  graphic;  <I>urx</I> and <I>ury</I> are the x and y
              coordinates  of  the  upper  right  corner  of  the
              graphic;  <I>width</I>  and  <I>height</I> are integers that give
              the desired width and height in groff units of  the
              graphic.  The graphic will be scaled so that it has
              this width and height and translated  so  that  the
              lower  left corner of the graphic is located at the
              position associated with <B>\X</B> command.  If the height
              argument  is omitted it will be scaled uniformly in
              the x and y directions so that it has the specified
              width.   Note  that  the contents of the <B>\X</B> command
              are not interpreted by <B>troff</B>; so vertical space for
              the  graphic  is  not  automatically added, and the
              <I>width</I> and <I>height</I> arguments are not allowed to  have
              attached  scaling  indicators.   If  the PostScript
              file complies with the Adobe  Document  Structuring
              Conventions  and  contains a <B>%%BoundingBox</B> comment,
              then  the  bounding  box   can   be   automatically
              extracted  from  within  groff  by  using  the <B>psbb</B>
              request.

              The <B>-mps</B> macros  (which  are  automatically  loaded
              when  <B>grops</B>  is run by the groff command) include a
              <B>PSPIC</B> macro which allows a  picture  to  be  easily
              imported.  This has the format
              The <B>-I</B> option causes the graphic to be indented  by
              <I>n</I>.

       <B>\X'ps:</B> <B>invis'</B>
       <B>\X'ps:</B> <B>endinvis'</B>
              No  output  will  be generated for text and drawing
              commands that are bracketed with these <B>\X</B> commands.
              These  commands  are  intended  for use when output
              from <B>troff</B> will be previewed before being processed
              with  <B>grops</B>;  if the previewer is unable to display
              certain characters or other constructs, then  other
              substitute characters or constructs can be used for
              previewing by bracketing them with  these  <B>\X</B>  com­
              mands.

              For  example,  <B>gxditview</B>  is  not able to display a
              proper <B>\(em</B>  character  because  the  standard  X11
              fonts  do not provide it; this problem can be over­
              come by executing the following request

                     <B>.char</B> <B>\(em</B> <B>\X'ps:</B> <B>invis'\</B>
                     <B>\Z'\v'-.25m'\h'.05m'\D'l</B> <B>.9m</B> <B>0'\h'.05m''\</B>
                     <B>\X'ps:</B> <B>endinvis'\(em</B>

              In this case, <B>gxditview</B> will be unable  to  display
              the  <B>\(em</B> character and will draw the line, whereas
              <B>grops</B> will print the <B>\(em</B> character and ignore  the
              line.

       The  input  to  <B>grops</B>  must  be  in  the  format output by
       <B>troff(1)</B>.  This is described in <B>groff_out(5)</B>.  In addition
       the  device and font description files for the device used
       must meet  certain  requirements.   The  device  and  font
       description  files  supplied  for <B>ps</B> device meet all these
       requirements.  <B>afmtodit(1)</B> can  be  used  to  create  font
       files  from  AFM files.  The resolution must be an integer
       multiple of 72 times the <B>sizescale</B>.  The <B>ps</B> device uses  a
       resolution  of  72000 and a sizescale of 1000.  The device
       description file should contain a command

              <B>paperlength</B> <I>n</I>

       which says that output should be generated which is  suit­
       able  for  printing  on  a  page whose length is <I>n</I> machine
       units.  Each font description file must contain a command

              <B>internalname</B> <I>psname</I>

       which says that the PostScript name of the font is <I>psname</I>.
       It may also contain a command

              <B>encoding</B> <I>enc</I><B>_</B><I>file</I>

       to select the character, even if the  character  does  not
       have  a groff name.  Every character in the font file must
       exist in the PostScript font, and the widths given in  the
       font  file  must  match  the widths used in the PostScript
       font.  <B>grops</B> will assume that a  character  with  a  groff
       name  of  <B>space</B>  is blank (makes no marks on the page); it
       can make use of such a character to  generate  more  effi­
       cient and compact PostScript output.

       <B>grops</B>  can  automatically  include  the downloadable fonts
       necessary to print the document.  Any  downloadable  fonts
       which  should, when required, be included by <B>grops</B> must be
       listed              in              the               file
       <B>/usr/share/groff/1.17.2/font/devps/download</B>;  this  should
       consist of lines of the form

              <I>font</I>  <I>filename</I>

       where <I>font</I> is the PostScript name of the font,  and  <I>file­</I>
       <I>name</I>  is  the  name of the file containing the font; lines
       beginning with <B>#</B> and blank lines are ignored;  fields  may
       be  separated by tabs or spaces; <I>filename</I> will be searched
       for using the same mechanism that is used for  groff  font
       metric  files.   The  <B>download</B>  file  itself  will also be
       searched for using this mechanism.

       If the file containing a  downloadable  font  or  imported
       document  conforms  to the Adobe Document Structuring Con­
       ventions, then <B>grops</B> will interpret any  comments  in  the
       files  sufficiently  to ensure that its own output is con­
       forming.  It will also supply any  needed  font  resources
       that are listed in the <B>download</B> file as well as any needed
       file resources.  It is also able to handle  inter-resource
       dependencies.   For example, suppose that you have a down­
       loadable font called Garamond,  and  also  a  downloadable
       font  called  Garamond-Outline  which  depends on Garamond
       (typically it would be defined  to  copy  Garamond's  font
       dictionary,  and  change the PaintType), then it is neces­
       sary for Garamond to be appear before Garamond-Outline  in
       the PostScript document.  <B>grops</B> will handle this automati­
       cally provided that the downloadable font file  for  Gara­
       mond-Outline indicates its dependence on Garamond by means
       of the Document Structuring Conventions,  for  example  by
       beginning with the following lines

              <B>%!PS-Adobe-3.0</B> <B>Resource-Font</B>
              <B>%%DocumentNeededResources:</B> <B>font</B> <B>Garamond</B>
              <B>%%EndComments</B>
              <B>%%IncludeResource:</B> <B>font</B> <B>Garamond</B>

       In this case both Garamond and Garamond-Outline would need
       to be listed in the <B>download</B> file.   A  downloadable  font
              logue  file <B>prologue</B>.  The option <B>-P</B> overrides this
              environment variable.
