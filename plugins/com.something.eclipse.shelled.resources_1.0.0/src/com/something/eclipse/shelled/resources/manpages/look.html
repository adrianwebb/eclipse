<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <B>look</B> utility displays any lines in <I>file</I> which contain <I>string</I> as a
     prefix.  As <B>look</B> performs a binary search, the lines in <I>file</I> must be
     sorted (where <B>sort(1)</B> got the same options -d and/or -f that <B>look</B> is
     invoked with).

     If <I>file</I> is not specified, the file <I>/usr/share/dict/words</I> is used, only
     alphanumeric characters are compared and the case of alphabetic charac­
     ters is ignored.

     Options:

     <B>-d</B>      Dictionary character set and order, i.e. only alphanumeric char­
             acters are compared.

     <B>-f</B>      Ignore the case of alphabetic characters.

     <B>-a</B>      Use the alternate dictionary <I>/usr/share/dict/web2</I>

     <B>-t</B>      Specify a string termination character, i.e. only the characters
             in <I>string</I> up to and including the first occurrence of <I>termchar</I>
             are compared.

     The <B>look</B> utility exits 0 if one or more lines were found and displayed, 1
     if no lines were found, and &gt;1 if an error occurred.

<H2>COMPATIBILITY</H2><PRE>
     The original manual page stated that tabs and blank characters partici­
     pated in comparisons when the <B>-d</B> option was specified.  This was incor­
     rect and the current man page matches the historic implementation.
