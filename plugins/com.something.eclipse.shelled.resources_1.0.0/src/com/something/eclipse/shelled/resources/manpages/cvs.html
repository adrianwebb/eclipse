<H2>NOTE</H2><PRE>
       This  manpage  is a summary of some of the features of <B>cvs</B>
       but it may no longer be kept up-to-date.  For more current
       and  in-depth documentation, please consult the Cederqvist
       manual  (via  the  <B>info</B>  <B>cvs</B>  command  or  otherwise,   as
       described in the SEE ALSO section of this manpage).

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       CVS  is a version control system, which allows you to keep
       old versions of files (usually source code), keep a log of
       who,  when,  and  why  changes occurred, etc., like RCS or
       SCCS.  Unlike the simpler systems, CVS does not just oper­
       ate  on one file at a time or one directory at a time, but
       operates on hierarchical collections of  directories  con­
       sisting  of version controlled files.  CVS helps to manage
       releases and to control the concurrent editing  of  source
       files  among  multiple  authors.   CVS  allows triggers to
       enable/log/control various operations and works well  over
       a wide area network.

       <B>cvs</B>  keeps a single copy of the master sources.  This copy
       is called the source ``repository''; it contains  all  the
       information   to   permit   extracting  previous  software
       releases at any time based on either a  symbolic  revision
       tag, or a date in the past.


</PRE>
<H2>ESSENTIAL COMMANDS</H2><PRE>
       <B>cvs</B>  provides  a  rich variety of commands (<I>cvs</I><B>_</B><I>command</I> in
       the Synopsis),  each  of  which  often  has  a  wealth  of
       options, to satisfy the many needs of source management in
       distributed environments.  However, you don't have to mas­
       ter every detail to do useful work with <B>cvs</B>; in fact, five
       commands are sufficient to use  (and  contribute  to)  the
       source repository.

       <B>cvs</B> <B>checkout</B> <I>modules</I>...
              A  necessary preliminary for most <B>cvs</B> work: creates
              your private copy of the source for <I>modules</I>  (named
              collections of source; you can also use a path rel­
              ative to the source repository here).  You can work
              with  this  copy  without  interfering with others'
              work.  At least one subdirectory  level  is  always
              created.

       <B>cvs</B> <B>update</B>
              Execute  this  command  from  <I>within</I>  your  private
              source directory  when  you  wish  to  update  your
              copies  of  source  files  from  changes that other
              to declare that you wish to  eliminate  files  from
              the repository.  The removal does not affect others
              until you run `<B>cvs</B> <B>commit</B>'.

       <B>cvs</B> <B>commit</B> <I>file</I>...
              Use this command when you wish to ``publish''  your
              changes  to other developers, by incorporating them
              in the source repository.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The <B>cvs</B> command line can include <I>cvs</I><B>_</B><I>options</I>, which  apply
       to the overall <B>cvs</B> program; a <I>cvs</I><B>_</B><I>command</I>, which specifies
       a particular action on the  source  repository;  and  <I>com­</I>
       <I>mand</I><B>_</B><I>options</I>  and  <I>command</I><B>_</B><I>arguments</I> to fully specify what
       the <I>cvs</I><B>_</B><I>command</I> will do.

       <I>Warning:</I> you must be careful of precisely where you  place
       options  relative to the <I>cvs</I><B>_</B><I>command</I>.  The same option can
       mean different things depending on whether it  is  in  the
       <I>cvs</I><B>_</B><I>options</I>  position (to the left of a <B>cvs</B> command) or in
       the <I>command</I><B>_</B><I>options</I> position (to the right of a  <B>cvs</B>  com­
       mand).

       There  are only two situations where you may omit <I>cvs</I><B>_</B><I>com­</I>
       <I>mand</I>: `<B>cvs</B> <B>-H</B>' or `<B>cvs</B> <B>--help</B>' elicits a list of available
       commands, and `<B>cvs</B> <B>-v</B>' or `<B>cvs</B> <B>--version</B>' displays version
       information on <B>cvs</B> itself.



</PRE>
<H2>CVS OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       As of release 1.6, <B>cvs</B> supports GNU style long options  as
       well  as  short options.  Only a few long options are cur­
       rently supported, these are listed in brackets  after  the
       short options whose functions they duplicate.

       Use these options to control the overall <B>cvs</B> program:

       <B>-H</B> <B>[</B> <B>--help</B> <B>]</B>
              Display   usage  information  about  the  specified
              <I>cvs</I><B>_</B><I>command</I> (but do not actually execute  the  com­
              mand).   If  you don't specify a command name, `<B>cvs</B>
              <B>-H</B>' displays a summary of all the  commands  avail­
              able.

       <B>-Q</B>     Causes  the command to be <I>really</I> quiet; the command
              will generate output only for serious problems.

       <B>-q</B>     Causes the command to be somewhat  quiet;  informa­
              tional  messages,  such  as  reports  of  recursion
              through subdirectories, are suppressed.

       <B>-b</B> <I>bindir</I>
              Overrides the setting of the CVSEDITOR, VISUAL, and
              EDITOR environment variables.

       <B>-f</B>     Do not read the <B>cvs</B> startup file (<I>~/.cvsrc</I>).

       <B>-l</B>     Do  not  log the <I>cvs</I><B>_</B><I>command</I> in the command history
              (but execute it anyway).  See  the  description  of
              the <B>history</B> command for information on command his­
              tory.

       <B>-n</B>     Do not change any files.  Attempt  to  execute  the
              <I>cvs</I><B>_</B><I>command</I>,  but  only  to  issue  reports; do not
              remove, update, or merge  any  existing  files,  or
              create any new files.

       <B>-t</B>     Trace  program  execution; display messages showing
              the steps of  <B>cvs</B>  activity.   Particularly  useful
              with <B>-n</B> to explore the potential impact of an unfa­
              miliar command.

       <B>-r</B>     Makes new working files read-only.  Same effect  as
              if the CVSREAD environment variable is set.

       <B>-v</B> <B>[</B> <B>--version</B> <B>]</B>
              Displays version and copyright information for <B>cvs</B>.

       <B>-w</B>     Makes  new  working  files  read-write   (default).
              Overrides  the  setting  of the CVSREAD environment
              variable.

       <B>-x</B>     Encrypt all communication between  the  client  and
              the  server.   As  of  this  writing,  this is only
              implemented when using a Kerberos connection.

       <B>-z</B> <I>compression-level</I>
              When transferring files across the network use <B>gzip</B>
              with  compression  level  <I>compression-level</I> to com­
              press and de-compress data as  it  is  transferred.
              Requires  the  presence  of the GNU <B>gzip</B> program in
              the current search path at both ends of the link.


</PRE>
<H2>USAGE</H2><PRE>
       Except when requesting general help  with  `<B>cvs</B>  <B>-H</B>',  you
       must  specify  a  <I>cvs</I><B>_</B><I>command</I>  to <B>cvs</B> to select a specific
       release control function to  perform.   Each  <B>cvs</B>  command
       accepts its own collection of options and arguments.  How­
       ever, many options are available across several  commands.
       You can display a usage summary for each command by speci­
       fying the <B>-H</B> option with the command.


</PRE>
<H2>CVS STARTUP FILE</H2><PRE>
       Normally, when CVS starts up, it  reads  the  <I>.cvsrc</I>  file


</PRE>
<H2>CVS COMMAND SUMMARY</H2><PRE>
       Here are brief descriptions of all the <B>cvs</B> commands:

       <B>add</B>    Add a new file  or  directory  to  the  repository,
              pending  a `<B>cvs</B> <B>commit</B>' on the same file.  Can only
              be done from within sources created by  a  previous
              `<B>cvs</B>  <B>checkout</B>'  invocation.   Use  `<B>cvs</B> <B>import</B>' to
              place whole new hierarchies of  sources  under  <B>cvs</B>
              control.   (Does  not  directly  affect repository;
              changes working directory.)

       <B>admin</B>  Execute control functions on the source repository.
              (Changes  repository  directly; uses working direc­
              tory without changing it.)

       <B>checkout</B>
              Make a working directory of source files for  edit­
              ing.  (Creates or changes working directory.)

       <B>commit</B> Apply  to the source repository changes, additions,
              and  deletions   from   your   working   directory.
              (Changes repository.)

       <B>diff</B>   Show differences between files in working directory
              and source repository, or between two revisions  in
              source repository.  (Does not change either reposi­
              tory or working directory.)

       <B>export</B> Prepare copies of a set of source files  for  ship­
              ment off site.  Differs from `<B>cvs</B> <B>checkout</B>' in that
              no <B>cvs</B> administrative directories are created  (and
              therefore  `<B>cvs</B>  <B>commit</B>'  cannot be executed from a
              directory prepared with `<B>cvs</B> <B>export</B>'), and  a  sym­
              bolic  tag  must  be  specified.   (Does not change
              repository; creates directory  similar  to  working
              directories).

       <B>history</B>
              Show  reports  on  <B>cvs</B>  commands that you or others
              have executed on a particular file or directory  in
              the source repository.  (Does not change repository
              or working directory.)  History logs are kept  only
              if   enabled  by  creation  of  the  `<B>$CVSROOT/CVS­</B>
              <B>ROOT/history</B>' file; see <B>cvs(5)</B>.

       <B>import</B> Incorporate a set of updates from off-site into the
              source   repository,   as   a   ``vendor  branch''.
              (Changes repository.)

       <B>init</B>   Initialize a repository by adding the CVSROOT  sub­
              directory  and some default control files. You must

       <B>remove</B> Remove files from the source repository, pending  a
              `<B>cvs</B> <B>commit</B>' on the same files.  (Does not directly
              affect repository; changes working directory.)

       <B>rtag</B>   Explicitly specify a symbolic  tag  for  particular
              revisions  of  files in the source repository.  See
              also `<B>cvs</B> <B>tag</B>'.  (Changes repository directly; does
              not require or affect working directory.)

       <B>status</B> Show  current status of files: latest version, ver­
              sion in working directory, whether working  version
              has  been  edited and, optionally, symbolic tags in
              the RCS file.  (Does not change repository or work­
              ing directory.)

       <B>tag</B>    Specify a symbolic tag for files in the repository.
              By default, tags the revisions that were last  syn­
              chronized  with  your working directory.   (Changes
              repository directly; uses working directory without
              changing it.)

       <B>update</B> Bring  your  working  directory  up  to  date  with
              changes from the repository.  Merges are  performed
              automatically when possible; a warning is issued if
              manual  resolution  is  required  for   conflicting
              changes.   (Changes  working  directory;  does  not
              change repository.)


</PRE>
<H2>COMMON COMMAND OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       This section describes the <I>command</I><B>_</B><I>options</I> that are avail­
       able  across  several <B>cvs</B> commands.  Not all commands sup­
       port all of these options; each option is  only  supported
       for  commands  where it makes sense.  However, when a com­
       mand has one of these options you can count  on  the  same
       meaning  for the option as in other commands.  (Other com­
       mand options, which are listed with  the  individual  com­
       mands, may have different meanings from one <B>cvs</B> command to
       another.)  <I>Warning:</I> the <B>history</B> command is  an  exception;
       it  supports  many  options  that conflict even with these
       standard options.

       <B>-D</B> <I>date</I><B>_</B><I>spec</I>
              Use  the  most  recent  revision  no   later   than
              <I>date</I><B>_</B><I>spec</I>  (a  single  argument,  date  description
              specifying a date in the past).  A wide variety  of
              date  formats  are  supported,  in  particular  ISO
              ("1972-09-24 20:05")  or  Internet  ("24  Sep  1972
              20:05").   The <I>date</I><B>_</B><I>spec</I> is interpreted as being in
              the local timezone, unless a specific  timezone  is
              specified.   The  specification  is ``sticky'' when
              you use it to make a private copy of a source file;
                        <B>a</B> <B>fortnight</B> <B>ago</B>
                        <B>3/31/92</B> <B>10:00:07</B> <B>PST</B>
                        <B>January</B> <B>23,</B> <B>1987</B> <B>10:05pm</B>
                        <B>22:00</B> <B>GMT</B>

       <B>-f</B>     When you specify a particular date or  tag  to  <B>cvs</B>
              commands,  they  normally  ignore files that do not
              contain the tag (or did not exist on the date) that
              you specified.  Use the <B>-f</B> option if you want files
              retrieved even when there is no match for  the  tag
              or  date.  (The most recent version is used in this
              situation.)  <B>-f</B> is available with  these  commands:
              <B>checkout</B>, <B>export</B>, <B>rdiff</B>, <B>rtag</B>, and <B>update</B>.

       <B>-k</B> <I>kflag</I>
              Alter  the  default processing of keywords.  The <B>-k</B>
              option is available with the <B>add</B>,  <B>checkout</B>,  <B>diff</B>,
              <B>export</B>,  <B>rdiff</B>,  and  <B>update</B>  commands.  Your <I>kflag</I>
              specification is ``sticky'' when you use it to cre­
              ate  a private copy of a source file; that is, when
              you use this option with  the  <B>checkout</B>  or  <B>update</B>
              commands,  <B>cvs</B>  associates your selected <I>kflag</I> with
              the file, and  continues  to  use  it  with  future
              <B>update</B>  commands on the same file until you specify
              otherwise.

              Some of the more useful <I>kflag</I>s are -ko and -kb (for
              binary  files),  and  -kv  which  is  useful for an
              <B>export</B> where you wish to retain keyword information
              after an <B>import</B> at some other site.

       <B>-l</B>     Local;  run  only  in  current  working  directory,
              rather  than  recurring   through   subdirectories.
              Available  with  the  following commands: <B>checkout</B>,
              <B>commit</B>, <B>diff</B>, <B>export</B>, <B>remove</B>, <B>rdiff</B>, <B>rtag</B>,  <B>status</B>,
              <B>tag</B>,  and <B>update</B>.  <I>Warning:</I> this is not the same as
              the overall `<B>cvs</B> <B>-l</B>' option, which you can  specify
              to the <I>left</I> of a <B>cvs</B> command!

       <B>-n</B>     Do  <I>not</I> run any <B>checkout</B>/<B>commit</B>/<B>tag</B>/<B>update</B> program.
              (A program can be specified to run on each of these
              activities,  in  the  modules database; this option
              bypasses it.)  Available with the <B>checkout</B>, <B>commit</B>,
              <B>export</B>,  and  <B>rtag</B>  commands.  <I>Warning:</I> this is not
              the same as the overall `<B>cvs</B> <B>-n</B>' option, which  you
              can specify to the <I>left</I> of a <B>cvs</B> command!

       <B>-P</B>     Prune  (remove)  directories  that  are empty after
              being updated, on <B>checkout</B>, or  <B>update</B>.   Normally,
              an  empty  directory (one that is void of revision-
              controlled files) is  left  alone.   Specifying  <B>-P</B>
              will cause these directories to be silently removed
              mand, two special tags are always available: `<B>HEAD</B>'
              refers  to the most recent version available in the
              repository, and `<B>BASE</B>' refers to the  revision  you
              last  checked  out  into the current working direc­
              tory.

              The <I>tag</I> specification is ``sticky''  when  you  use
              this  option with `<B>cvs</B> <B>checkout</B>' or `<B>cvs</B> <B>update</B>' to
              make your own copy of a file: <B>cvs</B> remembers the <I>tag</I>
              and  continues to use it on future <B>update</B> commands,
              until you specify otherwise.  <I>tag</I> can be  either  a
              symbolic  or numeric tag.  Specifying the <B>-q</B> global
              option along with the <B>-r</B> command  option  is  often
              useful,  to  suppress the warning messages when the
              RCS file does not contain the specified tag.  <B>-r</B> is
              available with the <B>checkout</B>, <B>commit</B>, <B>diff</B>, <B>history</B>,
              <B>export</B>, <B>rdiff</B>, <B>rtag</B>, and <B>update</B> commands.  <I>Warning:</I>
              this  is  not  the  same  as  the  overall `<B>cvs</B> <B>-r</B>'
              option, which you can specify to the <I>left</I> of a  <B>cvs</B>
              command!

<H2>CVS COMMANDS</H2><PRE>
       Here (finally) are details on all the <B>cvs</B> commands and the
       options each accepts.  The summary lines  at  the  top  of
       each   command's  description  highlight  three  kinds  of
       things:

           Command Options and Arguments
                 Special options are described in  detail  below;
                 common  command  options  may appear only in the
                 summary line.

           Working Directory, or Repository?
                 Some <B>cvs</B> commands require a working directory to
                 operate;  some require a repository.  Also, some
                 commands <I>change</I> the repository, some change  the
                 working directory, and some change nothing.

           Synonyms
                 Many  commands have synonyms, which you may find
                 easier to remember (or type) than the  principal
                 name.


       <B>add</B> [<B>-k</B> <I>kflag</I>] [<B>-m</B> <B>'</B><I>message</I><B>'</B>] <I>files...</I>
              <I>Requires:</I> repository, working directory.
              <I>Changes:</I> working directory.
              <I>Synonym:</I> <B>new</B>
              Use  the <B>add</B> command to create a new file or direc­
              tory in the source repository.  The files or direc­
              tories specified with <B>add</B> must already exist in the
              current directory (which  must  have  been  created
              even  if  someone else created that directory after
              your <B>checkout</B> of the sources.  You can do the  fol­
              lowing:

                        <B>example%</B> <B>mkdir</B> <B>new_directory</B>
                        <B>example%</B> <B>cvs</B> <B>add</B> <B>new_directory</B>
                        <B>example%</B> <B>cvs</B> <B>update</B> <B>new_directory</B>

              An alternate approach using `<B>cvs</B> <B>update</B>' might be:

                        <B>example%</B> <B>cvs</B> <B>update</B> <B>-d</B> <B>new_directory</B>

              (To add <I>any</I> <I>available</I> new directories to your work­
              ing directory, it's probably simpler  to  use  `<B>cvs</B>
              <B>checkout</B>' or `<B>cvs</B> <B>update</B> <B>-d</B>'.)

              The added files are not placed in the source repos­
              itory until you use `<B>cvs</B> <B>commit</B>' to make the change
              permanent.   Doing  a  `<B>cvs</B> <B>add</B>' on a file that was
              removed with the `<B>cvs</B> <B>remove</B>' command  will  resur­
              rect  the  file,  if no `<B>cvs</B> <B>commit</B>' command inter­
              vened.

              You will have the opportunity to specify a  logging
              message,  as  usual,  when  you use `<B>cvs</B> <B>commit</B>' to
              make the new file permanent.  If you'd like to have
              another  logging  message associated with just <I>cre­</I>
              <I>ation</I> of the file (for  example,  to  describe  the
              file's  purpose),  you  can specify it with the `<B>-m</B>
              <I>message</I>' option to the <B>add</B> command.

              The `<B>-k</B> <B>kflag</B>' option  specifies  the  default  way
              that  this  file  will be checked out.  The `<B>kflag</B>'
              argument is stored in  the  RCS  file  and  can  be
              changed with `<B>cvs</B> <B>admin</B>'.  Specifying `<B>-ko</B>' is use­
              ful for checking in binaries  that  shouldn't  have
              keywords expanded.

       <B>admin</B> [<I>rcs-options</I>] <I>files...</I>
              <I>Requires:</I> repository, working directory.
              <I>Changes:</I> repository.
              <I>Synonym:</I> <B>rcs</B>
              This  is  the <B>cvs</B> interface to assorted administra­
              tive facilities, similar to <B>rcs(1)</B>.   This  command
              works  recursively, so extreme care should be used.

       <B>checkout</B> [<B>options</B>] <I>modules</I>...
              <I>Requires:</I> repository.
              <I>Changes:</I> working directory.
              <I>Synonyms:</I> <B>co</B>, <B>get</B>
              Make a working directory containing copies  of  the
              source  files  specified by <I>modules</I>.  You must exe­
              whether other software developers are editing their
              own  copies of the sources); update them to include
              new changes applied by others to the source reposi­
              tory;  or commit your work as a permanent change to
              the repository.

              Note that <B>checkout</B> is used to  create  directories.
              The  top-level directory created is always added to
              the directory where <B>checkout</B> is invoked,  and  usu­
              ally has the same name as the specified <I>module</I>.  In
              the case of a <I>module</I> alias, the created  sub-direc­
              tory may have a different name, but you can be sure
              that it will be a sub-directory, and that  <B>checkout</B>
              will show the relative path leading to each file as
              it is extracted into your private work area (unless
              you specify the <B>-Q</B> global option).

              Running  `<B>cvs</B>  <B>checkout</B>'  on  a  directory that was
              already built by a prior <B>checkout</B> is  also  permit­
              ted,  and  has the same effect as specifying the <B>-d</B>
              option to the <B>update</B> command described below.

              The <I>options</I> permitted with `<B>cvs</B>  <B>checkout</B>'  include
              the standard command options <B>-P</B>, <B>-f</B>, <B>-k</B> <I>kflag</I> , <B>-l</B>,
              <B>-n</B>, <B>-p</B>, <B>-r</B> <I>tag</I>, and <B>-D</B> <I>date</I>.

              In addition to those, you  can  use  these  special
              command options with <B>checkout</B>:

              Use  the <B>-A</B> option to reset any sticky tags, dates,
              or <B>-k</B> options.  (If you get a  working  file  using
              one of the <B>-r</B>, <B>-D</B>, or <B>-k</B> options, <B>cvs</B> remembers the
              corresponding tag, date,  or  <I>kflag</I>  and  continues
              using  it  on  future updates; use the <B>-A</B> option to
              make <B>cvs</B> forget these specifications, and  retrieve
              the ``head'' version of the file).

              The  <B>-j</B>  <I>branch</I>  option  merges  the  changes  made
              between the resulting  revision  and  the  revision
              that  it  is based on (e.g., if the tag refers to a
              branch, <B>cvs</B> will merge all  changes  made  in  that
              branch into your working file).

              With  two <B>-j</B> options, <B>cvs</B> will merge in the changes
              between the two respective revisions.  This can  be
              used  to ``remove'' a certain delta from your work­
              ing file.

              In addition, each <B>-j</B> option can contain on optional
              date  specification which, when used with branches,
              can limit the chosen revision to one within a  spe­
              cific  date.   An  optional  date  is  specified by
              ifying any files or  directories  in  your  working
              directory.

              Use  the <B>-d</B> <I>dir</I> option to create a directory called
              <I>dir</I> for the working files,  instead  of  using  the
              module  name.   Unless  you  also use <B>-N</B>, the paths
              created under <I>dir</I> will be as short as possible.

              Use the <B>-s</B>  option  to  display  per-module  status
              information  stored  with  the <B>-s</B> option within the
              modules file.

       <B>commit</B> [<B>-lnR</B>] [<B>-m</B> '<I>log</I><B>_</B><I>message</I>' | <B>-F</B> <I>file</I>]  [<B>-r</B>  <I>revision</I>]
       [<I>files...</I>]
              <I>Requires:</I> working directory, repository.
              <I>Changes:</I> repository.
              <I>Synonym:</I> <B>ci</B>
              Use `<B>cvs</B>  <B>commit</B>'  when  you  want  to  incorporate
              changes  from  your  working  source files into the
              general source repository.

              If you don't specify particular  <I>files</I>  to  commit,
              all  of the files in your working current directory
              are examined.  <B>commit</B> is careful to change  in  the
              repository  only  those  files that you have really
              changed.  By default (or if you explicitly  specify
              the  <B>-R</B>  option),  files in subdirectories are also
              examined and committed if they  have  changed;  you
              can  use  the <B>-l</B> option to limit <B>commit</B> to the cur­
              rent directory only.  Sometimes  you  may  want  to
              force  a  file  to  be  committed even though it is
              unchanged; this is achieved with the <B>-f</B> flag, which
              also has the effect of disabling recursion (you can
              turn it back on with <B>-R</B> of course).

              <B>commit</B> verifies that the selected files are  up  to
              date  with  the  current  revisions  in  the source
              repository; it will notify you,  and  exit  without
              committing,  if  any of the specified files must be
              made current first with `<B>cvs</B> <B>update</B>'.  <B>commit</B>  does
              not  call  the  <B>update</B>  command for you, but rather
              leaves that for you to do when the time is right.

              When all is well, an editor is invoked to allow you
              to  enter a log message that will be written to one
              or more logging programs and placed in  the  source
              repository  file.   You can instead specify the log
              message on the command line  with  the  <B>-m</B>  option,
              thus  suppressing the editor invocation, or use the
              <B>-F</B> option to specify that the  argument  <I>file</I>  con­
              tains the log message.

              mands.  Then, either <B>checkout</B> or <B>update</B> can be used
              to base your sources on the newly  created  branch.
              From  that point on, all <B>commit</B> changes made within
              these working sources will be  automatically  added
              to  a branch revision, thereby not perturbing main-
              line development in any way.  For example,  if  you
              had  to  create  a  patch to the 1.2 version of the
              product, even though the  2.0  version  is  already
              under development, you might do:

                        <B>example%</B> <B>cvs</B> <B>rtag</B> <B>-b</B> <B>-rFCS1_2</B> <B>FCS1_2_Patch</B> <B>product_module</B>
                        <B>example%</B> <B>cvs</B> <B>checkout</B> <B>-rFCS1_2_Patch</B> <B>product_module</B>
                        <B>example%</B> <B>cd</B> <B>product_module</B>
                        <B>[[</B> <B>hack</B> <B>away</B> <B>]]</B>
                        <B>example%</B> <B>cvs</B> <B>commit</B>

              Say you have been working on some extremely experi­
              mental software, based  on  whatever  revision  you
              happened  to checkout last week.  If others in your
              group would like to work on this software with you,
              but  without  disturbing main-line development, you
              could commit your change to a new  branch.   Others
              can  then checkout your experimental stuff and uti­
              lize the full benefit of <B>cvs</B>  conflict  resolution.
              The scenario might look like:

                        <B>example%</B> <B>cvs</B> <B>tag</B> <B>-b</B> <B>EXPR1</B>
                        <B>example%</B> <B>cvs</B> <B>update</B> <B>-rEXPR1</B>
                        <B>[[</B> <B>hack</B> <B>away</B> <B>]]</B>
                        <B>example%</B> <B>cvs</B> <B>commit</B>

              Others  would simply do `<B>cvs</B> <B>checkout</B> <B>-rEXPR1</B> <B>what­</B>
              <B>ever_module</B>' to work with you on  the  experimental
              change.

              <I>Requires:</I> working directory, repository.
              <I>Changes:</I> nothing.
              You  can  compare your working files with revisions
              in the source repository, with the `<B>cvs</B> <B>diff</B>'  com­
              mand.   If you don't specify a particular revision,
              your files are compared  with  the  revisions  they
              were  based  on.  You can also use the standard <B>cvs</B>
              command option <B>-r</B> to specify a particular  revision
              to compare your files with.  Finally, if you use <B>-r</B>
              twice, you can see differences  between  two  revi­
              sions  in  the repository.  You can also specify <B>-D</B>
              options to diff against a  revision  in  the  past.
              The <B>-r</B> and <B>-D</B> options can be mixed together with at
              most two options ever specified.

              <I>Changes:</I> current directory.
              This command is a variant of `<B>cvs</B> <B>checkout</B>'; use it
              when you want a copy of the source for <I>module</I> with­
              out  the <B>cvs</B> administrative directories.  For exam­
              ple, you might use `<B>cvs</B> <B>export</B>' to  prepare  source
              for  shipment off-site.  This command <I>requires</I> that
              you specify a date or tag (with <B>-D</B> or <B>-r</B>), so  that
              you can count on reproducing the source you ship to
              others.

              The only non-standard options are `<B>-d</B>  <I>dir</I>'  (write
              the  source  into  directory  <I>dir</I>)  and `<B>-N</B>' (don't
              shorten module paths).  These have the  same  mean­
              ings as the same options in `<B>cvs</B> <B>checkout</B>'.

              The <B>-kv</B> option is useful when <B>export</B> is used.  This
              causes any keywords to be  expanded  such  that  an
              <B>import</B>  done  at  some other site will not lose the
              keyword revision information.  Other <I>kflag</I>s may  be
              used  with `<B>cvs</B> <B>export</B>' and are described in <B>co(1)</B>.

              commands.  You can use  `<B>cvs</B>  <B>history</B>'  to  display
              this information in various formats.

              <I>Warning:</I>  `<B>cvs</B>  <B>history</B>' uses `<B>-f</B>', `<B>-l</B>', `<B>-n</B>', and
              `<B>-p</B>' in ways that conflict with the descriptions in
              COMMON COMMAND OPTIONS.

              Several  options  (shown  above as <B>-</B><I>report</I>) control
              what kind of report is generated:

             <B>-c</B>  Report on each time <B>commit</B> was used (i.e.,  each
                 time the repository was modified).

             <B>-m</B> <I>module</I>
                 Report  on  a particular <I>module</I>.  (You can mean­
                 ingfully use <B>-m</B> more than once  on  the  command
                 line.)

             <B>-o</B>  Report on checked-out modules.

             <B>-T</B>  Report on all tags.

             <B>-x</B> <I>type</I>
                 Extract  a particular set of record types <I>X</I> from
                 the <B>cvs</B> history.  The  types  are  indicated  by
                 single  letters, which you may specify in combi­

             <B>-e</B>  Everything  (all  record  types);  equivalent to
                 specifying `<B>-xMACFROGWUT</B>'.

             <B>-z</B> <I>zone</I>
                 Use  time  zone  <I>zone</I>  when  outputting  history
                 records.   The  zone  name  <B>LT</B>  stands for local
                 time; numeric offsets stand for hours  and  min­
                 utes  ahead  of  UTC.  For example, <B>+0530</B> stands
                 for 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of  (i.e.  east
                 of) UTC.

            The  options  shown  as  <B>-</B><I>flags</I>  constrain the report
            without requiring option arguments:

             <B>-a</B>  Show data for all users (the default is to  show
                 data only for the user executing `<B>cvs</B> <B>history</B>').

             <B>-l</B>  Show last modification only.

             <B>-w</B>  Show only the  records  for  modifications  done
                 from  the same working directory where `<B>cvs</B> <B>his­</B>
                 <B>tory</B>' is executing.

            The options shown  as  <B>-</B><I>options</I>  <I>args</I>  constrain  the
            report based on an argument:

             <B>-b</B> <I>str</I>
                 Show data back to a record containing the string
                 <I>str</I> in either the module name, the file name, or
                 the repository path.

             <B>-D</B> <I>date</I>
                 Show data since <I>date</I>.

             <B>-p</B> <I>repository</I>
                 Show  data  for  a  particular source repository
                 (you can specify several <B>-p</B> options on the  same
                 command line).

             <B>-r</B> <I>rev</I>
                 Show  records  referring  to revisions since the
                 revision or tag named <I>rev</I> appears in  individual
                 RCS  files.   Each  RCS file is searched for the
                 revision or tag.

             <B>-t</B> <I>tag</I>
                 Show records since tag <I>tag</I> was last added to the
                 history  file.   This  differs  from the <B>-r</B> flag
                 above in that it reads only  the  history  file,
                 not the RCS files, and is much faster.


              The  <I>repository</I> argument gives a directory name (or
              a path to a directory) under the CVS root directory
              for  repositories;  if the directory did not exist,
              <B>import</B> creates it.

              When you use <B>import</B> for updates to source that  has
              been  modified  in  your source repository (since a
              prior <B>import</B>), it will notify you of any files that
              conflict  in  the  two branches of development; use
              `<B>cvs</B> <B>checkout</B> <B>-j</B>' to reconcile the differences,  as
              <B>import</B> instructs you to do.

              By  default,  certain file names are ignored during
              `<B>cvs</B> <B>import</B>': names associated with CVS administra­
              tion,  or with other common source control systems;
              common names for patch files, object files, archive
              files,  and  editor  backup  files; and other names
              that are usually artifacts of  assorted  utilities.
              For  an  up to date list of ignored file names, see
              the Cederqvist manual (as described in the SEE ALSO
              section of this manpage).

              The  outside  source  is  saved  in  a  first-level
              branch, by default `<B>1.1.1</B>'.  Updates are leaves  of
              this  branch;  for  example,  files  from the first
              imported collection  of  source  will  be  revision
              `<B>1.1.1.1</B>',  then  files  from  the  first  imported
              update will be revision `<B>1.1.1.2</B>', and so on.

              At least three arguments are required.   <I>repository</I>
              is  needed  to  identify  the collection of source.
              <I>vendortag</I> is a tag for the entire branch (e.g., for
              `<B>1.1.1</B>').   You  must  also  specify  at  least one
              <I>releasetag</I> to identify the files at the leaves cre­
              ated each time you execute `<B>cvs</B> <B>import</B>'.

              One  of  the standard <B>cvs</B> command options is avail­
              able: <B>-m</B> <I>message</I>.  If you do not specify a  logging
              message  with  <B>-m</B>,  your editor is invoked (as with
              <B>commit</B>) to allow you to enter one.

              There are three additional special options.

              Use `<B>-d</B>' to specify that each file's time  of  last
              modification  should  be  used for the checkin date
              and time.

              Use `<B>-b</B> <I>branch</I>' to  specify  a  first-level  branch
              other than `<B>1.1.1</B>'.

              Use  `<B>-I</B> <I>name</I>' to specify file names that should be
              full explanations.  This command  is  recursive  by
              default, unless the <B>-l</B> option is specified.

       <B>rdiff</B>  [<B>-</B><I>flags</I>]  [<B>-V</B>  <I>vn</I>]  [<B>-r</B>  <I>t</I>|<B>-D</B> <I>d</I> [<B>-r</B> <I>t2</I>|<B>-D</B> <I>d2</I>]] <I>mod­</I>
       <I>ules...</I>
              <I>Requires:</I> repository.
              <I>Changes:</I> nothing.
              <I>Synonym:</I> <B>patch</B>
              Builds  a  Larry  Wall format <B>patch(1)</B> file between
              two releases, that can be  fed  directly  into  the
              <B>patch</B>  program  to  bring an old release up-to-date
              with the new release.  (This is one of the few  <B>cvs</B>
              commands  that  operates  directly from the reposi­
              tory, and doesn't require a prior  <B>checkout</B>.)   The
              diff  output is sent to the standard output device.
              You can specify  (using  the  standard  <B>-r</B>  and  <B>-D</B>
              options) any combination of one or two revisions or
              dates.  If only one revision or date is  specified,
              the  patch  file  reflects differences between that
              revision or date and the current ``head'' revisions
              in the RCS file.

              Note  that if the software release affected is con­
              tained in more than one directory, then it  may  be
              necessary  to  specify  the  <B>-p</B> option to the <B>patch</B>
              command when patching  the  old  sources,  so  that
              <B>patch</B> is able to find the files that are located in
              other directories.

              The standard option <I>flags</I> <B>-f</B>, and <B>-l</B> are  available
              with  this command.  There are also several special
              options flags:

              If you use the <B>-s</B> option, no patch output  is  pro­
              duced.   Instead, a summary of the changed or added
              files between the two releases is sent to the stan­
              dard  output  device.   This  is useful for finding
              out, for example, which files have changed  between
              two dates or revisions.

              If  you  use  the  <B>-t</B> option, a diff of the top two
              revisions is sent to the  standard  output  device.
              This is most useful for seeing what the last change
              to a file was.

              If you use the <B>-u</B> option, the patch output uses the
              newer ``unidiff'' format for context diffs.

              You  can use <B>-c</B> to explicitly specify the `<B>diff</B> <B>-c</B>'
              form of context diffs (which is  the  default),  if
              you like.

              present; that you are executing it from immediately
              above, or inside, a <B>cvs</B> working directory; and that
              the repository recorded for your files is the  same
              as the repository defined in the module database.

              If  all  these  conditions  are true, `<B>cvs</B> <B>release</B>'
              leaves a record of its execution (attesting to your
              intentionally  abandoning your checkout) in the <B>cvs</B>
              history log.

              You can use the <B>-d</B> flag to request that your  work­
              ing  copies  of  the source files be deleted if the
              <B>release</B> succeeds.

       <B>remove</B> [<B>-lR</B>] [<I>files...</I>]
              <I>Requires:</I> Working directory.
              <I>Changes:</I> Working directory.
              <I>Synonyms:</I> <B>rm</B>, <B>delete</B>
              Use this command to declare that you wish to remove
              <I>files</I>  from  the  source repository.  Like most <B>cvs</B>
              commands, `<B>cvs</B> <B>remove</B>' works on files in your work­
              ing  directory, not directly on the repository.  As
              a safeguard, it also requires that you first  erase
              the specified files from your working directory.

              The  files are not actually removed until you apply
              your changes to the repository with <B>commit</B>; at that
              point,  the  corresponding  RCS files in the source
              repository are <I>moved</I>  into  the  `<B>Attic</B>'  directory
              (also within the source repository).

              This  command  is  recursive by default, scheduling
              all physically removed  files  that  it  finds  for
              removal  by  the next <B>commit</B>.  Use the <B>-l</B> option to
              avoid this recursion, or just specify  that  actual
              files that you wish remove to consider.

       <B>rtag</B>  [<B>-falnRQq</B>] [<B>-b</B>] [<B>-d</B>] [<B>-r</B> <I>tag</I> | <B>-D</B> <I>date</I>] <I>symbolic</I><B>_</B><I>tag</I>
       <I>modules...</I>
              <I>Requires:</I> repository.
              <I>Changes:</I> repository.
              <I>Synonym:</I> <B>rfreeze</B>
              You can use this command to assign symbolic tags to
              particular, explicitly specified source versions in
              the  repository.   `<B>cvs</B> <B>rtag</B>' works directly on the
              repository contents (and requires no  prior  <B>check­</B>
              <B>out</B>).  Use `<B>cvs</B> <B>tag</B>' instead, to base the selection
              of versions to tag on the contents of your  working
              directory.

              In general, tags (often the symbolic names of soft­
              ware distributions) should not be removed, but  the
              most  useful  for  creating a patch to a previously
              released software distribution.

              You can use the standard <B>-r</B> and <B>-D</B> options  to  tag
              only  those  files  that  already contain a certain
              tag.  This method would be used to  rename  a  tag:
              tag  only the files identified by the old tag, then
              delete the old tag, leaving the new tag on  exactly
              the same files as the old tag.

              <B>rtag</B>  executes  recursively by default, tagging all
              subdirectories of <I>modules</I> you specify in the  argu­
              ment.   You can restrict its operation to top-level
              directories with the standard <B>-l</B> option; or you can
              explicitly request recursion with <B>-R</B>.

              The  modules database can specify a program to exe­
              cute whenever a tag is specified; a typical use  is
              to  send  electronic  mail to a group of interested
              parties.  If you want to bypass that  program,  use
              the standard <B>-n</B> option.

              Use  the <B>-a</B> option to have <B>rtag</B> look in the `<B>Attic</B>'
              for removed files that contain the  specified  tag.
              The tag is removed from these files, which makes it
              convenient to re-use a symbolic tag as  development
              continues (and files get removed from the up-coming
              distribution).

       <B>status</B> [<B>-lRqQ</B>] [<B>-v</B>] [<I>files</I>...]
              <I>Requires:</I> working directory, repository.
              <I>Changes:</I> nothing.
              Display a brief report on  the  current  status  of
              <I>files</I>   with  respect  to  the  source  repository,
              including  any  ``sticky''  tags,  dates,   or   <B>-k</B>
              options.   (``Sticky''  options  will  restrict how
              `<B>cvs</B> <B>update</B>' operates until you reset them; see the
              description of `<B>cvs</B> <B>update</B> <B>-A...</B>'.)

              You  can  also  use  this command to anticipate the
              potential impact of a `<B>cvs</B> <B>update</B>' on your  working
              source  directory.  If you do not specify any <I>files</I>
              explicitly, reports are shown for  all  files  that
              <B>cvs</B>  has placed in your working directory.  You can
              limit the scope  of  this  search  to  the  current
              directory  itself (not its subdirectories) with the
              standard <B>-l</B> option  flag;  or  you  can  explicitly
              request   recursive  status  reports  with  the  <B>-R</B>
              option.

              The <B>-v</B> option causes the symbolic tags for the  RCS
              file to be displayed as well.
              from  locally modified files in your working direc­
              tory.  If you want to avoid doing this by  mistake,
              specify the <B>-c</B> option to <B>cvs</B> <B>tag</B>.  If there are any
              locally modified files,  CVS  will  abort  with  an
              error before it tags any files.

              One use for tags is to record a ``snapshot'' of the
              current sources when the software freeze date of  a
              project  arrives.   As  bugs  are  fixed  after the
              freeze date, only those changed sources that are to
              be part of the release need be re-tagged.

              The  symbolic  tags are meant to permanently record
              which revisions of which files were used in  creat­
              ing  a software distribution.  The <B>checkout</B>, <B>export</B>
              and <B>update</B> commands allow you to extract  an  exact
              copy of a tagged release at any time in the future,
              regardless of  whether  files  have  been  changed,
              added, or removed since the release was tagged.

              You  can  use the standard <B>-r</B> and <B>-D</B> options to tag
              only those files that  already  contain  a  certain
              tag.   This  method  would be used to rename a tag:
              tag only the files identified by the old tag,  then
              delete  the old tag, leaving the new tag on exactly
              the same files as the old tag.

              Specifying the <B>-f</B> flag in addition to the <B>-r</B> or  <B>-D</B>
              flags  will  tag  those  files named on the command
              line even if they do not contain the old tag or did
              not exist on the specified date.

              By  default  (without a <B>-r</B> or <B>-D</B> flag) the versions
              to be tagged are supplied  implicitly  by  the  <B>cvs</B>
              records  of your working files' history rather than
              applied explicitly.

              If you use `<B>cvs</B> <B>tag</B> <B>-d</B> <I>symbolic</I><B>_</B><I>tag</I><B>...</B>',  the  sym­
              bolic  tag  you specify is <I>deleted</I> instead of being
              added.  <I>Warning</I>: Be very  certain  of  your  ground
              before  you  delete  a  tag; doing this effectively
              discards some  historical  information,  which  may
              later turn out to have been valuable.

              `<B>cvs</B>  <B>tag</B>' will not move a tag that already exists.
              With the <B>-F</B> option, however,  `<B>cvs</B>  <B>tag</B>'  will  re-
              locate  any  instance  of <I>symbolic</I><B>_</B><I>tag</I> that already
              exists on that file to the new repository versions.
              Without  the <B>-F</B> option, attempting to use `<B>cvs</B> <B>tag</B>'
              to apply a tag that already  exists  on  that  file
              will produce an error message.

              copy of source from the  common  repository,  other
              developers   will  continue  changing  the  central
              source.  From time to time, when it  is  convenient
              in your development process, you can use the <B>update</B>
              command from within your working directory to  rec­
              oncile your work with any revisions applied to  the
              source  repository  since  your  last  <B>checkout</B>  or
              <B>update</B>.

              <B>update</B> keeps you informed of its progress by print­
              ing a line for each file, prefaced with one of  the
              characters  `<B>U</B>  <B>P</B> <B>A</B> <B>R</B> <B>M</B> <B>C</B> <B>?</B>' to indicate the status
              of the file:

       <B>U</B> <I>file</I>    The file was brought <I>up</I> <I>to</I> <I>date</I> with respect  to
                 the  repository.  This is done for any file that
                 exists in the repository but not in your source,
                 and  for  files that you haven't changed but are
                 not the most recent versions  available  in  the
                 repository.

       <B>P</B> <I>file</I>    Like <B>U</B>, but the CVS server sends a patch instead
                 of an entire file.  This accomplishes  the  same
                 thing as <B>U</B> using less bandwidth.

       <B>A</B> <I>file</I>    The  file has been <I>added</I> to your private copy of
                 the sources, and will be  added  to  the  source
                 repository  when  you  run  `<B>cvs</B>  <B>commit</B>' on the
                 file.  This is a reminder to you that  the  file
                 needs to be committed.

       <B>R</B> <I>file</I>    The file has been <I>removed</I> from your private copy
                 of the sources, and will  be  removed  from  the
                 source  repository  when you run `<B>cvs</B> <B>commit</B>' on
                 the file.  This is a reminder to  you  that  the
                 file needs to be committed.

       <B>M</B> <I>file</I>    The  file is <I>modified</I> in your working directory.
                 `<B>M</B>' can indicate one of two states  for  a  file
                 you're  working on: either there were no modifi­
                 cations to the same file in the  repository,  so
                 that  your  file  remains as you last saw it; or
                 there were modifications in  the  repository  as
                 well  as in your copy, but they were <I>merged</I> suc­
                 cessfully, without  conflict,  in  your  working
                 directory.

       <B>C</B> <I>file</I>    A  <I>conflict</I>  was  detected while trying to merge
                 your changes  to  <I>file</I>  with  changes  from  the
                 source repository.  <I>file</I> (the copy in your work­
                 ing directory) is now the result of merging  the
                 two versions; an unmodified copy of your file is

            Use the <B>-A</B> option to reset any sticky tags, dates, or
            <B>-k</B>  options.  (If you get a working copy of a file by
            using one of the <B>-r</B>, <B>-D</B>, or <B>-k</B> options, <B>cvs</B> remembers
            the  corresponding  tag, date, or <I>kflag</I> and continues
            using it on future updates; use the <B>-A</B> option to make
            <B>cvs</B>  forget  these  specifications,  and retrieve the
            ``head'' version of the file).

            The <B>-j</B><I>branch</I> option merges the changes  made  between
            the  resulting  revision  and the revision that it is
            based on (e.g., if the tag refers to  a  branch,  <B>cvs</B>
            will  merge all changes made in that branch into your
            working file).

            With two <B>-j</B> options, <B>cvs</B> will merge  in  the  changes
            between  the  two  respective revisions.  This can be
            used to ``remove'' a certain delta from your  working
            file.   E.g.,  If the file foo.c is based on revision
            1.6 and I want to remove the changes made between 1.3
            and 1.5, I might do:

                      <B>example%</B> <B>cvs</B> <B>update</B> <B>-j1.5</B> <B>-j1.3</B> <B>foo.c</B>   <B>#</B> <B>note</B> <B>the</B> <B>order...</B>

            In  addition,  each <B>-j</B> option can contain on optional
            date specification which, when  used  with  branches,
            can  limit  the  chosen revision to one within a spe­
            cific date.  An optional date is specified by  adding
            a colon (:) to the tag.

                      <B>-jSymbolic_Tag:Date_Specifier</B>

            Use  the  <B>-d</B>  option  to  create any directories that
            exist in the repository if they're missing  from  the
            working  directory.   (Normally,  update acts only on
            directories and files that were already  enrolled  in
            your working directory.)  This is useful for updating
            directories that were created in the repository since
            the  initial <B>checkout</B>; but it has an unfortunate side
            effect.  If you deliberately avoided certain directo­
            ries  in the repository when you created your working
            directory (either through use of a module name or  by
            listing  explicitly  the  files  and  directories you
            wanted on the command line), then  updating  with  <B>-d</B>
            will  create those directories, which may not be what
            you want.

            Use <B>-I</B> <I>name</I> to ignore files whose  names  match  <I>name</I>
            (in  your  working directory) during the update.  You
            can specify <B>-I</B> more than once on the command line  to
            specify  several files to ignore.  By default, <B>update</B>
            ignores files whose names match certain patterns; for

       For more detailed information on <B>cvs</B> supporting files, see
       <B>cvs(5)</B>.

       <I>Files</I> <I>in</I> <I>home</I> <I>directories:</I>

       .cvsrc The  <B>cvs</B>  initialisation  file.  Lines in this file
              can be used to specify default options for each <B>cvs</B>
              command.   For  example  the  line  `<B>diff</B>  <B>-c</B>' will
              ensure that `<B>cvs</B> <B>diff</B>'  is  always  passed  the  <B>-c</B>
              option  in  addition to any other options passed on
              the command line.

       .cvswrappers
              Specifies wrappers to be used in addition to  those
              specified  in  the  CVSROOT/cvswrappers file in the
              repository.

       <I>Files</I> <I>in</I> <I>working</I> <I>directories:</I>

       CVS    A directory of <B>cvs</B> administrative  files.   <I>Do</I>  <I>not</I>
              <I>delete.</I>

       CVS/Entries
              List and status of files in your working directory.

       CVS/Entries.Backup
              A backup of `<B>CVS/Entries</B>'.

       CVS/Entries.Static
              Flag: do not add more entries on `<B>cvs</B> <B>update</B>'.

       CVS/Root
              Pathname to the repository ( CVSROOT ) location  at
              the time of checkout.  This file is used instead of
              the CVSROOT environment variable if the environment
              variable  is  not  set.   A warning message will be
              issued when the contents of this file and the  CVS­
              ROOT  environment variable differ.  The file may be
              over-ridden    by    the    presence     of     the
              CVS_IGNORE_REMOTE_ROOT environment variable.

       CVS/Repository
              Pathname  to  the  corresponding  directory  in the
              source repository.

       CVS/Tag
              Contains the per-directory ``sticky'' tag  or  date
              information.  This file is created/updated when you
              specify <B>-r</B> or <B>-D</B> to the  <B>checkout</B>  or  <B>update</B>  com­
              mands, and no files are specified.

       CVS/Checkin.prog

       CVSROOT/cvswrappers,v
              Records <B>cvs</B> wrapper commands to be used when check­
              ing files into and out of the repository.  Wrappers
              allow  the file or directory to be processed on the
              way in and out of CVS.  The intended uses are many,
              one  possible  use  would  be  to reformat a C file
              before the file is checked in, so all of  the  code
              in the repository looks the same.

       CVSROOT/editinfo,v
              Records  programs  for editing/validating `<B>cvs</B> <B>com­</B>
              <B>mit</B>' log entries.

       CVSROOT/history
              Log file of <B>cvs</B> transactions.

       CVSROOT/loginfo,v
              Records  programs  for  piping  `<B>cvs</B>  <B>commit</B>'   log
              entries.

       CVSROOT/modules,v
              Definitions for modules in this repository.

       CVSROOT/rcsinfo,v
              Records  pathnames  to templates used during a `<B>cvs</B>
              <B>commit</B>' operation.

       CVSROOT/taginfo,v
              Records programs for validating/logging  `<B>cvs</B>  <B>tag</B>'
              and `<B>cvs</B> <B>rtag</B>' operations.

       MODULE/Attic
              Directory for removed source files.

       #cvs.lock
              A  lock  directory created by <B>cvs</B> when doing sensi­
              tive changes to the source repository.

       #cvs.tfl.<I>pid</I>
              Temporary lock file for repository.

       #cvs.rfl.<I>pid</I>
              A read lock.

       #cvs.wfl.<I>pid</I>
              A write lock.

<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2><PRE>
       CVSROOT
              Should contain the full pathname to the root of the
              <B>cvs</B>  source  repository  (where  the  RCS files are

       RCSBIN Specifies the full pathname where to find RCS  pro­
              grams, such as <B>co(1)</B> and <B>ci(1)</B> (CVS 1.9 and older).

       CVSEDITOR
              Specifies the program to use for recording log mes­
              sages  during  <B>commit</B>.   If not set, the VISUAL and
              EDITOR environment variables  are  tried  (in  that
              order).   If  neither  is  set,  a system-dependent
              default editor (e.g., <B>vi</B>) is used.

       CVS_IGNORE_REMOTE_ROOT
              If this variable is set then <B>cvs</B>  will  ignore  all
              references  to  remote repositories in the CVS/Root
              file.

       CVS_RSH
              <B>cvs</B> uses the contents of this variable to determine
              the  name  of  the remote shell command to use when
              starting a <B>cvs</B> server.  If this variable is not set
              then `<B>rsh</B>' is used.

       CVS_SERVER
              <B>cvs</B> uses the contents of this variable to determine
              the name of the <B>cvs</B> server command.  If this  vari­
              able is not set then `<B>cvs</B>' is used.

       CVSWRAPPERS
              This  variable  is used by the `<B>cvswrappers</B>' script
              to determine the name of the wrapper file, in addi­
              tion  to  the  wrappers  defaults  contained in the
              repository  (CVSROOT/cvswrappers)  and  the  user's
              home directory (~/.cvswrappers).
