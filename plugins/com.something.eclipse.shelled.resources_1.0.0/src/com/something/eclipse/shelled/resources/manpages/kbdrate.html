<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>kbdrate</B>  is  used  to  change the keyboard repeat rate and
       delay time.  The delay is the amount of time  that  a  key
       must be depressed before it will start to repeat.

       Using  <B>kbdrate</B>  without  any options will reset the repeat
       rate to 10.9 characters per second (cps) and the delay  to
       250  milliseconds  (ms) for Intel- and M68K-based systems.
       These are the IBM defaults. On SPARC-based systems it will
       reset the repeat rate to 5 cps and the delay to 200 ms.

       <B>-r</B> <I>rate</I>
              Change  the keyboard repeat rate to <I>rate</I> cps.   For
              Intel-based systems, the allowable  range  is  from
              2.0 to 30.0 cps.  Only certain, specific values are
              possible, and the program will select  the  nearest
              possible  value to the one specified.  The possible
              values are given, in characters per second, as fol­
              lows:  2.0, 2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.7, 3.0, 3.3, 3.7, 4.0,
              4.3, 4.6, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.7, 7.5, 8.0,  8.6,  9.2,
              10.0,  10.9,  12.0,  13.3,  15.0, 16.0, 17.1, 18.5,
              20.0, 21.8, 24.0, 26.7, 30.0.  For SPARC-based sys­
              tems,  the allowable range is from 0 (no repeat) to
              50 cps.

       <B>-d</B> <I>delay</I>
              Change the delay to <I>delay</I> milliseconds.  For Intel-
              based  systems,  the allowable range is from 250 to
              1000 ms, in 250 ms steps. For SPARC systems, possi­
              ble  values are between 10 ms and 1440 ms, in 10 ms
              steps.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       Not all keyboards support all rates.

       Not all keyboards have the rates mapped in the same way.

       Setting the repeat rate on  the  Gateway  AnyKey  keyboard
       does  not work.  If someone with a Gateway figures out how
       to  program  the  keyboard,  please  send  mail  to  util-
       linux@math.uio.no.

       All this is very architecture dependent.  Nowadays <B>kbdrate</B>
