<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>ddate</B> <B>[+format]</B> <B>[date]</B>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>ddate</B> prints the date in Discordian date format.

       If  called  with  no arguments, <B>ddate</B> will get the current
       system date, convert this to the  Discordian  date  format
       and  print  this  on the standard output. Alternatively, a
       Gregorian date may be specified on the  command  line,  in
       the form of a numerical day, month and year.

       If  a format string is specified, the Discordian date will
       be printed in a format specified by the string. This mech­
       anism  works  similarly  to the format string mechanism of
       <B>date(1),</B> only almost completely  differently.  The  fields
       are:

       %A     Full name of the day of the week (i.e., Sweetmorn)

       %a     Abbreviated name of the day of the week (i.e., SM)

       %B     Full name of the season (i.e., Chaos)

       %b     Abbreviated name of the season (i.e., Chs)

       %d     Ordinal number of day in season (i.e., 23)

       %e     Cardinal number of day in season (i.e., 23rd)

       %H     Name of current Holyday, if any

       %N     Magic  code  to  prevent  rest of format from being
              printed unless today is a Holyday.

       %X     Number of days remaining until X-Day. (Not valid if
              the SubGenius options are not compiled in.)

       %{

       %}     Used  to enclose the part of the string which is to
              be replaced with the words "St. Tib's Day"  if  the
              current day is St. Tib's Day.

       Celebrate Bureflux

       % ddate +'Today's %{%A, the %e of %B%}, %Y. %N%nCelebrate %H' 29 2 1996
       Today's St. Tib's Day, 3162.



</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       <B>ddate(1)</B> will produce undefined behaviour if asked to pro­
       duce the date for St. Tib's day and its format string does
       not contain the St. Tib's Day delimiters %{ and %}.



</PRE>
<H2>NOTE</H2><PRE>
       After  `X-Day'  passed without incident, the Church of the
       SubGenius declared that it had got the year upside down  -
       X-Day  is  actually in 8661 AD rather than 1998 AD.  Thus,
       the True X-Day is Cfn 40, 9827.
