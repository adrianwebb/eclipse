       If you're new to Perl, you should start with perlintro,
       which is a general intro for beginners and provides some
       background to help you navigate the rest of Perl's exten­
       sive documentation.

       For ease of access, the Perl manual has been split up into
       several sections.

       By default, the manpages listed above are installed in the
       <I>/usr/local/man/</I> directory.


           perl -V:man.dir

       If the directories have a common stem, such as
       <I>/usr/local/man/man1</I> and <I>/usr/local/man/man3</I>, you need only
       to add that stem (<I>/usr/local/man</I>) to your <B>man(1)</B> configu­
       ration files or your MANPATH environment variable.  If
       they do not share a stem, you'll have to add both stems.

       If that doesn't work for some reason, you can still use
       the supplied <I>perldoc</I> script to view module information.
       You might also look into getting a replacement man pro­
       gram.

       If something strange has gone wrong with your program and
       you're not sure where you should look for help, try the <B>-w</B>
       switch first.  It will often point out exactly where the
       trouble is.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Perl is a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text
       files, extracting information from those text files, and
       printing reports based on that information.  It's also a
       good language for many system management tasks.  The lan­
       guage is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient,
       complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).

       Perl combines (in the author's opinion, anyway) some of
       the best features of C, <B>sed</B>, <B>awk</B>, and <B>sh</B>, so people famil­
       iar with those languages should have little difficulty
       with it.  (Language historians will also note some ves­
       tiges of <B>csh</B>, Pascal, and even BASIC-PLUS.)  Expression
       syntax corresponds closely to C expression syntax.  Unlike
       most Unix utilities, Perl does not arbitrarily limit the
       size of your data--if you've got the memory, Perl can
       slurp in your whole file as a single string.  Recursion is
       of unlimited depth.  And the tables used by hashes (some­
       times called "associative arrays") grow as necessary to
       prevent degraded performance.  Perl can use sophisticated
       pattern matching techniques to scan large amounts of data
       quickly.  Although optimized for scanning text, Perl can
       also deal with binary data, and can make dbm files look
       like hashes.  Setuid Perl scripts are safer than C pro­
       grams through a dataflow tracing mechanism that prevents
       many stupid security holes.

       If you have a problem that would ordinarily use <B>sed</B> or <B>awk</B>
       or <B>sh</B>, but it exceeds their capabilities or must run a
       little faster, and you don't want to write the silly thing
       in C, then Perl may be for you.  There are also transla­
       tors to turn your <B>sed</B> and <B>awk</B> scripts into Perl scripts.

</PRE>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
       The "use warnings" pragma (and the <B>-w</B> switch) produces
       some lovely diagnostics.

       See perldiag for explanations of all Perl's diagnostics.
       The "use diagnostics" pragma automatically turns Perl's
       normally terse warnings and errors into these longer
       forms.

       Compilation errors will tell you the line number of the
       error, with an indication of the next token or token type
       that was to be examined.  (In a script passed to Perl via
       <B>-e</B> switches, each <B>-e</B> is counted as one line.)

       Setuid scripts have additional constraints that can pro­
       duce error messages such as "Insecure dependency".  See
       perlsec.

       Did we mention that you should definitely consider using
       the <B>-w</B> switch?


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       The <B>-w</B> switch is not mandatory.

       Perl is at the mercy of your machine's definitions of var­
       ious operations such as type casting, <I>atof()</I>, and float­
       ing-point output with <I>sprintf()</I>.

       If your stdio requires a seek or eof between reads and
       writes on a particular stream, so does Perl.  (This
       doesn't apply to <I>sysread()</I> and <I>syswrite()</I>.)

       While none of the built-in data types have any arbitrary
       size limits (apart from memory size), there are still a
       Lister, but don't tell anyone I said that.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       The Perl motto is "There's more than one way to do it."
       Divining how many more is left as an exercise to the
       reader.

       The three principal virtues of a programmer are Laziness,
       Impatience, and Hubris.  See the Camel Book for why.
