<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>GNU</I>  <I>Emacs</I> is a version of <I>Emacs,</I> written by the author of
       the original (PDP-10) <I>Emacs,</I> Richard Stallman.
       The primary documentation of GNU Emacs is in the GNU Emacs
       Manual, which you can read on line using Info, a subsystem
       of Emacs.  Please look there for complete  and  up-to-date
       documentation.  This man page is updated only when someone
       volunteers to do so; the Emacs maintainers' priority  goal
       is to minimize the amount of time this man page takes away
       from other more useful projects.
       The user functionality of GNU Emacs encompasses everything
       other  <I>Emacs</I> editors do, and it is easily extensible since
       its editing commands are written in Lisp.

       <I>Emacs</I> has an extensive interactive help facility, but  the
       facility  assumes  that  you  know how to manipulate <I>Emacs</I>
       windows and buffers.  CTRL-h (backspace or CTRL-h)  enters
       the  Help  facility.  Help Tutorial (CTRL-h t) requests an
       interactive tutorial which can teach beginners the  funda­
       mentals  of  <I>Emacs</I> in a few minutes.  Help Apropos (CTRL-h
       a) helps you find a command given its functionality,  Help
       Character (CTRL-h c) describes a given character's effect,
       and Help Function (CTRL-h f) describes a given Lisp  func­
       tion specified by name.

       <I>Emacs's</I>  Undo  can  undo  several steps of modification to
       your buffers, so it is easy to recover from  editing  mis­
       takes.

       <I>GNU</I>  <I>Emacs's</I>  many  special  packages  handle mail reading
       (RMail) and sending  (Mail),  outline  editing  (Outline),
       compiling  (Compile),  running subshells within <I>Emacs</I> win­
       dows (Shell), running a Lisp read-eval-print  loop  (Lisp-
       Interaction-Mode), and automated psychotherapy (Doctor).

       There is an extensive reference manual, but users of other
       Emacses should have little trouble adapting even without a
       copy.   Users  new to <I>Emacs</I> will be able to use basic fea­
       tures fairly rapidly by studying the  tutorial  and  using
       the self-documentation features.

       Emacs Options

       The following options are of general interest:

       <I>file</I>    Edit <I>file.</I>

       <B>+</B><I>number</I> Go  to the line specified by <I>number</I> (do not insert
               a space between the "+" sign and the number).

       <B>-l</B> <I>file</I> Load the lisp code in the file <I>file.</I>

       The  following  options are useful when running <I>Emacs</I> as a
       batch editor:

       <B>-batch</B>  Edit in batch mode.  The editor will send messages
               to  stderr.   This option must be the first in the
               argument list.  You must use -l and -f options  to
               specify files to execute and functions to call.

       <B>-kill</B>   Exit <I>Emacs</I> while in batch mode.

       Using Emacs with X

       <I>Emacs</I>  has  been  tailored  to work well with the X window
       system.  If you run <I>Emacs</I> from under X  windows,  it  will
       create  its own X window to display in.  You will probably
       want to start the editor as a background process  so  that
       you can continue using your original window.

       <I>Emacs</I> can be started with the following X switches:

       <B>-name</B> <I>name</I>
               Specifies the name which should be assigned to the
               initial <I>Emacs</I> window.  This controls looking up  X
               resources as well as the window title.

       <B>-title</B> <I>name</I>
               Specifies the title for the initial X window.

       <B>-r</B>      Display the <I>Emacs</I> window in reverse video.

       <B>-i</B>      Use the "kitchen sink" bitmap icon when iconifying
               the <I>Emacs</I> window.

       <B>-font</B> <I>font,</I> <B>-fn</B> <I>font</I>
               Set the <I>Emacs</I> window's font to that  specified  by
               <I>font.</I>   You  will  find the various <I>X</I> fonts in the
               <I>/usr/lib/X11/fonts</I>  directory.   Note  that  <I>Emacs</I>
               will only accept fixed width fonts.  Under the X11
               Release 4 font-naming conventions, any  font  with
               the  value "m" or "c" in the eleventh field of the
               font name is a  fixed  width  font.   Furthermore,
               fonts  whose name are of the form <I>width</I>x<I>height</I> are
               generally fixed width, as is the font <I>fixed</I>.   See
               <B>xlsfonts(1)</B> for more information.

               When  you  specify  a font, be sure to put a space
               between the switch and the font name.

       <B>-bw</B> <I>pixels</I>
               tion.  The width and height are specified in char­
               acters; the default is 80 by 24.


       <B>-fg</B> <I>color</I>
               On color displays, sets the color of the text.

               See the file <I>/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt</I> for  a  list  of
               valid color names.

       <B>-bg</B> <I>color</I>
               On  color displays, sets the color of the window's
               background.

       <B>-bd</B> <I>color</I>
               On color displays, sets the color of the  window's
               border.

       <B>-cr</B> <I>color</I>
               On  color displays, sets the color of the window's
               text cursor.

       <B>-ms</B> <I>color</I>
               On color displays, sets the color of the  window's
               mouse cursor.

       <B>-d</B> <I>displayname,</I> <B>-display</B> <I>displayname</I>
               Create  the  <I>Emacs</I> window on the display specified
               by <I>displayname</I>.  Must be the first  option  speci­
               fied in the command line.

       <B>-nw</B>     Tells <I>Emacs</I> not to use its special interface to X.
               If you use this switch when invoking <I>Emacs</I> from an
               <B>xterm(1)</B>  window,  display is done in that window.
               This must be the first  option  specified  in  the
               command line.

       You  can  set  <I>X</I>  default values for your <I>Emacs</I> windows in
       your <I>.Xresources</I> file (see <B>xrdb(1)</B>).   Use  the  following
       format:

              emacs.keyword:value

       where <I>value</I> specifies the default value of <I>keyword.</I>  <I>Emacs</I>
       lets you set default values for the following keywords:

       <B>font</B> <B>(</B>class <B>Font)</B>
               Sets the window's text font.

       <B>reverseVideo</B> <B>(</B>class <B>ReverseVideo)</B>
               If <I>reverseVideo's</I> value is set to <I>on,</I>  the  window
               will be displayed in reverse video.

       <B>background</B> <B>(</B>class <B>Background)</B>
               For color displays, sets the  window's  background
               color.

       <B>borderColor</B> <B>(</B>class <B>BorderColor)</B>
               For color displays, sets the color of the window's
               border.

       <B>cursorColor</B> <B>(</B>class <B>Foreground)</B>
               For color displays, sets the color of the window's
               text cursor.

       <B>pointerColor</B> <B>(</B>class <B>Foreground)</B>
               For color displays, sets the color of the window's
               mouse cursor.

       <B>geometry</B> <B>(</B>class <B>Geometry)</B>
               Sets  the  geometry  of  the  <I>Emacs</I>   window   (as
               described above).

       <B>title</B> <B>(</B>class <B>Title)</B>
               Sets the title of the <I>Emacs</I> window.

       <B>iconName</B> <B>(</B>class <B>Title)</B>
               Sets the icon name for the <I>Emacs</I> window icon.

       If  you  try  to  set color values while using a black and
       white display, the window's characteristics  will  default
       as follows: the foreground color will be set to black, the
       background color will be set to white,  the  border  color
       will  be  set to grey, and the text and mouse cursors will
       be set to black.

       Using the Mouse

       The following lists the  mouse  button  bindings  for  the
       <I>Emacs</I> window under X11.

       MOUSE BUTTON         FUNCTION
       left                 Set point.
       middle               Paste text.
       right                Cut text into X cut buffer.
       SHIFT-middle         Cut text into X cut buffer.
       SHIFT-right          Paste text.
       CTRL-middle          Cut  text  into X cut buffer and kill
                            it.
       CTRL-right           Select this  window,  then  split  it
                            into  two  windows.   Same  as typing
                            CTRL-x 2.
       CTRL-SHIFT-left      X buffer menu--hold the  buttons  and
                            keys  down,  wait for menu to appear,
                            select  buffer,  and  release.   Move

       able.  As with all software  and  publications  from  FSF,
       everyone is permitted to make and distribute copies of the
       Emacs manual.  The  TeX  source  to  the  manual  is  also
       included in the Emacs source distribution.



</PRE>
<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>
       /usr/local/info - files for the Info documentation browser
       (a subsystem of Emacs) to refer to.  Currently not much of
       Unix  is  documented  here,  but  the complete text of the
       Emacs reference manual is included in  a  convenient  tree
       structured form.

       /usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/src  -  C source files and
       object files

       /usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/lisp - Lisp  source  files
       and  compiled  files  that  define  most editing commands.
       Some are preloaded; others are autoloaded from this direc­
       tory when used.

       /usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc   -  various  programs
       that are used with GNU Emacs, and some files  of  informa­
       tion.

       /usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/DOC.*  -  contains the
       documentation  strings  for  the   Lisp   primitives   and
       preloaded  Lisp  functions  of GNU Emacs.  They are stored
       here to reduce the size of Emacs proper.

       /usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/OTHER.EMACSES     dis­
       cusses GNU Emacs vs. other versions of Emacs.
       /usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/SERVICE  lists  people
       offering various services to assist users  of  GNU  Emacs,
       including  education,  troubleshooting,  porting  and cus­
       tomization.
       These files also have information useful to anyone wishing
       to  write  programs  in the Emacs Lisp extension language,
       which has not yet been fully documented.

       /usr/local/com/emacs/lock - holds lock files that are made
       for all files being modified in Emacs, to prevent simulta­
       neous modification of one file by two users.

       /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt - list of valid X color names.



</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       There is a mailing list, bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu  on
       the   internet   (ucbvax!prep.ai.mit.edu!bug-gnu-emacs  on
       UUCPnet), for reporting Emacs bugs and fixes.  But  before
       reporting  something  as a bug, please try to be sure that
       ing list.  Send requests to be added to mailing  lists  to
       the  special  list  info-gnu-emacs-request@prep.ai.mit.edu
       (or the corresponding UUCP address).  For more information
       about     Emacs    mailing    lists,    see    the    file
       /usr/local/emacs/etc/MAILINGLISTS.  Bugs tend actually  to
       be  fixed if they can be isolated, so it is in your inter­
       est to report them in such a way that they can  be  easily
       reproduced.

       Bugs  that I know about are: shell will not work with pro­
       grams running in Raw mode on some Unix versions.

<H2>UNRESTRICTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <I>Emacs</I> is free; anyone may redistribute copies of <I>Emacs</I>  to
       anyone  under the terms stated in the <I>Emacs</I> General Public
       License, a copy of which accompanies each  copy  of  <I>Emacs</I>
       and which also appears in the reference manual.

       Copies  of  <I>Emacs</I>  may sometimes be received packaged with
       distributions of Unix systems, but it is never included in
       the  scope  of  any  license covering those systems.  Such
       inclusion violates the terms on which distribution is per­
       mitted.   In fact, the primary purpose of the General Pub­
       lic License is to prohibit anyone from attaching any other
       restrictions to redistribution of <I>Emacs.</I>

       Richard  Stallman  encourages  you  to  improve and extend
       <I>Emacs,</I> and urges that you contribute  your  extensions  to
       the  GNU library.  Eventually GNU (Gnu's Not Unix) will be
       a complete replacement for Berkeley Unix.   Everyone  will
       be free to use, copy, study and change the GNU system.
