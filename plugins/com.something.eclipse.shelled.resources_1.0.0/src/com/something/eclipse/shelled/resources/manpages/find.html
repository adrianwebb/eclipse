<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>find</B> [path...] [expression]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This  manual page documents the GNU version of <B>find</B>.  <B>find</B>
       searches the directory tree rooted at each given file name
       by  evaluating  the  given  expression from left to right,
       according to the rules of precedence (see  section  OPERA­
       TORS),  until  the outcome is known (the left hand side is
       false for <I>and</I> operations, true for  <I>or</I>),  at  which  point
       <B>find</B> moves on to the next file name.

       The first argument that begins with `-', `(', `)', `,', or
       `!' is taken to be the beginning of  the  expression;  any
       arguments before it are paths to search, and any arguments
       after it are the rest of the expression.  If no paths  are
       given, the current directory is used.  If no expression is
       given, the expression `-print' is used.

       <B>find</B> exits with status 0 if all files are  processed  suc­
       cessfully, greater than 0 if errors occur.


</PRE>
<H2>EXPRESSIONS</H2><PRE>
       The expression is made up of options (which affect overall
       operation rather than the processing of a  specific  file,
       and  always  return  true),  tests (which return a true or
       false value), and actions (which  have  side  effects  and
       return a true or false value), all separated by operators.
       -and is assumed where the operator  is  omitted.   If  the
       expression  contains  no actions other than -prune, -print
       is performed on all files  for  which  the  expression  is
       true.

   <B>OPTIONS</B>
       All  options always return true.  They always take effect,
       rather than being processed only when their place  in  the
       expression is reached.  Therefore, for clarity, it is best
       to place them at the beginning of the expression.

       -daystart
              Measure times (for -amin,  -atime,  -cmin,  -ctime,
              -mmin,  and  -mtime)  from  the  beginning of today
              rather than from 24 hours ago.

       -depth Process each directory's contents before the direc­
              tory itself.

       -follow
              Dereference symbolic links.  Implies -noleaf.

       -help, --help
              Print  a  summary of the command-line usage of <B>find</B>

       -mount Don't descend directories on other filesystems.  An
              alternate  name  for  -xdev, for compatibility with
              some other versions of <B>find</B>.

       -noleaf
              Do not optimize by assuming that  directories  con­
              tain  2  fewer  subdirectories than their hard link
              count.   This  option  is  needed  when   searching
              filesystems  that do not follow the Unix directory-
              link convention, such as CD-ROM or MS-DOS  filesys­
              tems or AFS volume mount points.  Each directory on
              a normal Unix filesystem has at least 2 hard links:
              its  name  and  its  `.'  entry.  Additionally, its
              subdirectories (if any) each  have  a  `..'   entry
              linked to that directory.  When <B>find</B> is examining a
              directory, after it has statted 2 fewer subdirecto­
              ries than the directory's link count, it knows that
              the rest of the entries in the directory  are  non-
              directories  (`leaf'  files in the directory tree).
              If only the files' names need to be examined, there
              is  no  need to stat them; this gives a significant
              increase in search speed.

       -version, --version
              Print the <B>find</B> version number and exit.

       -xdev  Don't descend directories on other filesystems.

   <B>TESTS</B>
       Numeric arguments can be specified as

       <I>+n</I>     for greater than <I>n</I>,

       <I>-n</I>     for less than <I>n</I>,

       <I>n</I>      for exactly <I>n</I>.

       -amin <I>n</I>
              File was last accessed <I>n</I> minutes ago.

       -anewer <I>file</I>
              File was last accessed more recently than <I>file</I>  was
              modified.   -anewer  is affected by -follow only if
              -follow comes before -anewer on the command line.

       -atime <I>n</I>
              File was last accessed <I>n</I>*24 hours ago.

       -cmin <I>n</I>
              File's status was last changed <I>n</I> minutes ago.

       -cnewer <I>file</I>
              File is on a filesystem of type  <I>type</I>.   The  valid
              filesystem  types  vary among different versions of
              Unix; an incomplete list of filesystem  types  that
              are accepted on some version of Unix or another is:
              ufs, 4.2, 4.3, nfs, tmp, mfs, S51K, S52K.  You  can
              use  -printf with the %F directive to see the types
              of your filesystems.

       -gid <I>n</I> File's numeric group ID is <I>n</I>.

       -group <I>gname</I>
              File belongs  to  group  <I>gname</I>  (numeric  group  ID
              allowed).

       -ilname <I>pattern</I>
              Like -lname, but the match is case insensitive.

       -iname <I>pattern</I>
              Like -name, but the match is case insensitive.  For
              example, the patterns `fo*'  and  `F??'  match  the
              file names `Foo', `FOO', `foo', `fOo', etc.

       -inum <I>n</I>
              File has inode number <I>n</I>.

       -ipath <I>pattern</I>
              Like -path, but the match is case insensitive.

       -iregex <I>pattern</I>
              Like -regex, but the match is case insensitive.

       -links <I>n</I>
              File has <I>n</I> links.

       -lname <I>pattern</I>
              File  is a symbolic link whose contents match shell
              pattern <I>pattern</I>.  The metacharacters do  not  treat
              `/' or `.' specially.

       -mmin <I>n</I>
              File's data was last modified <I>n</I> minutes ago.

       -mtime <I>n</I>
              File's data was last modified <I>n</I>*24 hours ago.

       -name <I>pattern</I>
              Base of file name (the path with the leading direc­
              tories removed) matches shell pattern <I>pattern</I>.  The
              metacharacters  (`*', `?', and `[]') do not match a
              `.' at the start of the base  name.   To  ignore  a
              directory  and  the files under it, use -prune; see
              an example in the description of -path.
              metacharacters  do  not treat `/' or `.' specially;
              so, for example,
                        find . -path './sr*sc'
              will  print  an  entry  for  a   directory   called
              './src/misc'  (if  one  exists).  To ignore a whole
              directory tree, use  -prune  rather  than  checking
              every  file  in the tree.  For example, to skip the
              directory `src/emacs' and all files and directories
              under  it,  and  print the names of the other files
              found, do something like this:
                        find  .  -path  './src/emacs'  -prune  -o
                        -print

       -perm <I>mode</I>
              File's  permission  bits are exactly <I>mode</I> (octal or
              symbolic).  Symbolic modes use mode 0 as a point of
              departure.

       -perm -<I>mode</I>
              All  of  the  permission  bits <I>mode</I> are set for the
              file.

       -perm +<I>mode</I>
              Any of the permission bits <I>mode</I>  are  set  for  the
              file.

       -regex <I>pattern</I>
              File name matches regular expression <I>pattern</I>.  This
              is a match on the whole path, not  a  search.   For
              example,  to match a file named `./fubar3', you can
              use the regular expression  `.*bar.'  or  `.*b.*3',
              but not `b.*r3'.

       -size <I>n</I>[bckw]
              File uses <I>n</I> units of space.  The units are 512-byte
              blocks by default or if `b' follows <I>n</I>, bytes if `c'
              follows  <I>n</I>,  kilobytes  if `k' follows <I>n</I>, or 2-byte
              words if `w' follows <I>n</I>.  The size  does  not  count
              indirect blocks, but it does count blocks in sparse
              files that are not actually allocated.

       -true  Always true.

       -type <I>c</I>
              File is of type <I>c</I>:

              b      block (buffered) special

              c      character (unbuffered) special

              d      directory

              last changed.

       -user <I>uname</I>
              File  is  owned  by  user  <I>uname</I>  (numeric  user ID
              allowed).

       -xtype <I>c</I>
              The same as -type unless the  file  is  a  symbolic
              link.   For symbolic links: if -follow has not been
              given, true if the file is a link to a file of type
              <I>c</I>; if -follow has been given, true if <I>c</I> is `l'.  In
              other words, for symbolic links, -xtype checks  the
              type of the file that -type does not check.

   <B>ACTIONS</B>
       -exec <I>command</I> ;
              Execute <I>command</I>; true if 0 status is returned.  All
              following arguments to <B>find</B> are taken to  be  argu­
              ments  to  the command until an argument consisting
              of `;' is encountered.  The string `{}' is replaced
              by the current file name being processed everywhere
              it occurs in the arguments to the command, not just
              in arguments where it is alone, as in some versions
              of <B>find</B>.  Both of these constructions might need to
              be  escaped  (with a `\') or quoted to protect them
              from expansion by the shell.  The command  is  exe­
              cuted in the starting directory.

       -fls <I>file</I>
              True; like -ls but write to <I>file</I> like -fprint.

       -fprint <I>file</I>
              True;  print the full file name into file <I>file</I>.  If
              <I>file</I> does not exist when <B>find</B> is run,  it  is  cre­
              ated;  if it does exist, it is truncated.  The file
              names ``/dev/stdout'' and ``/dev/stderr'' are  han­
              dled  specially;  they refer to the standard output
              and standard error output, respectively.

       -fprint0 <I>file</I>
              True; like -print0 but write to <I>file</I> like  -fprint.

       -fprintf <I>file</I> <I>format</I>
              True;  like -printf but write to <I>file</I> like -fprint.

       -ok <I>command</I> ;
              Like -exec but ask the user first (on the  standard
              input);  if the response does not start with `y' or
              `Y', do not run the command, and return false.

       -print True; print the full file name on the standard out­
              put, followed by a newline.
              escapes and directives are:

              \a     Alarm bell.

              \b     Backspace.

              \c     Stop printing from this  format  immediately
                     and flush the output.

              \f     Form feed.

              \n     Newline.

              \r     Carriage return.

              \t     Horizontal tab.

              \v     Vertical tab.

              \\     A literal backslash (`\').

              A  `\' character followed by any other character is
              treated as an ordinary character, so they both  are
              printed.

              %%     A literal percent sign.

              %a     File's   last  access  time  in  the  format
                     returned by the C `ctime' function.

              %A<I>k</I>    File's last access time in the format speci­
                     fied  by  <I>k</I>, which is either `@' or a direc­
                     tive for the  C  `strftime'  function.   The
                     possible values for <I>k</I> are listed below; some
                     of them might not be available on  all  sys­
                     tems,   due  to  differences  in  `strftime'
                     between systems.
