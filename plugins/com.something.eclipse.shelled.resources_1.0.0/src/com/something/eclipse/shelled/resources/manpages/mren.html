<H2>Note of warning</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation, and may  not  be  entirely
       accurate  or  complete.   See the end of this man page for
       details.

<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       The mren command is used to rename or move an existing MS-
       DOS file or subdirectory. Its syntax is:

       mren [-voOsSrRA] <I>sourcefile</I> <I>targetfile</I>


       Mren renames an existing file on an MS-DOS filesystem.

       In  verbose  mode,  Mren  displays the new filename if the
       name supplied is invalid.

       If the first syntax is used (only one sourcefile), and  if
       the target name doesn't contain any slashes or colons, the
       file (or subdirectory) is renamed in the  same  directory,
       instead  of  being  moved  to the current mcd directory as
       would be the case with mmove. Unlike the MS-DOS version of
       REN, mren can be used to rename directories.

<H2>Viewing the texi doc</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this  process  is
       only  approximative,  and  some items, such as crossrefer­
       ences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  translation
       process.   Indeed,  these items have no appropriate repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I strongly advise you to use  the  original  texinfo  doc.
       See  the  end of this manpage for instructions how to view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo  doc,
              run the following commands:

                     <B>./configure;</B> <B>make</B> <B>dvi;</B> <B>dvips</B> <B>mtools.dvi</B>



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:
       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.
       Indeed, in the info version certain examples are difficult
       to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
