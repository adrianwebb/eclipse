<H2>Note of warning</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation, and may  not  be  entirely
       accurate  or  complete.   See the end of this man page for
       details.

<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       The mtoolstest command is used to tests the mtools config­
       uration  files. To invoke it, just type mtoolstest without
       any arguments.  Mtoolstest reads the mtools  configuration
       files,  and prints the cumulative configuration to stdout.
       The output can be used  as  a  configuration  file  itself
       (although  you  might  want  to remove redundant clauses).
       You may use this program to convert  old-style  configura­
       tion files into new style configuration files.

<H2>Viewing the texi doc</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this  process  is
       only  approximative,  and  some items, such as crossrefer­
       ences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  translation
       process.   Indeed,  these items have no appropriate repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I strongly advise you to use  the  original  texinfo  doc.
       See  the  end of this manpage for instructions how to view
       the texinfo doc.
