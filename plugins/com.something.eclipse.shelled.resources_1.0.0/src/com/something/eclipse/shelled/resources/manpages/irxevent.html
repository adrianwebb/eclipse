<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Irxevent  is  a program that I wrote to send button clicks
       and key presses to X  applications  triggered  by  a  LIRC
       driven  remote  control.  You  can  control  your favorite
       CD/MP3 player or your TV tuner  program  or  any  other  X
       application  that  responds to keyboard or mouse input. If
       you like to you can send emacs ^X^S from your armchair.

       Irxevent is a complement to irexec and irpty.

       Irxevent works with the same config  file  as  irexec  and
       irpty  (~/.lircrc).  For a complete sample .lircrc look at
       examples/lircrc.

          LINE    = "config =" &lt;KEY|BUTTON|XYKEY&gt; &lt;TARGET&gt;
          XYKEY   = "xy_Key" &lt;x_position&gt; &lt;y_position&gt; &lt;MOD&gt;Keyname
          KEY     = "Key" &lt;MOD&gt;Keyname
          MOD     = ["shift-"]["numlock-"]["ctrl-"]["alt-"]["meta-"]
                    ["numlock-"]["mod3-"]["mod4-"]["scrlock-"]
          BUTTON  = "Button" &lt;1..5&gt; &lt;x_position&gt; &lt;y_position&gt;
          TARGET  = Windowname | "WindowID" id | "CurrentWindow" | "RootWindow"

          <I>Keyname:</I>
            is the key symbol that is declared in X windows. E.g.
            "Up" refers to the cursor arrow pointing up. "KP_Add"
            is the plus sign on the key pad. Just take a look  at
            irxevent.keys (in the documentation directory) if you
            are not sure about a symbol's name.
          <I>Windowname:</I>
            can be the first characters of the window  name  dis­
            played by the window manager or the name that is dis­
            played below the icon. Some  programs  use  the  name
            displayed by the window manager to show a lot of sta­
            tus information but don't change the icon name  (like
            xawtv).  Others append information to the window name
            ("GQmpeg - kill_windooz.mp3"). If neither window name
            nor  icon name match the given Windowname information
            from <B>XClassHint(3x)</B> will be checked.
          <I>CurrentWindow:</I>
            refers to the active window as returned by XGetInput­
            <B>Focus(3x)</B>.  Most  times  this is the window with your
            mouse pointer in it.
          <I>RootWindow:</I>
            refers to the <I>root</I> window  as  returned  by  RootWin­
            <B>dow(3x)</B>. You may need this to send events to the win­

       on your keypad).

       There  are  programs  that  do not accept any synthetic X-
       events by default because they can  cause  security  prob­
       lems.  Currently  xterm  and  xemacs  are  known to ignore
       events simulated by irxevent.

       You can however  make  xterm  accept  external  events  by
       enabling  "Allow  SendEvents"  in the "Main Options" (hold
       down the Ctrl button  and  press  the  left  mouse  button
       inside  the xterm window). You can as well place this line
       into your .Xresources file to change this permanently:

          XTerm.vt100.allowSendEvents: true

       Yet another possibility is to start xterm like this:

          xterm -xrm "XTerm.vt100.allowSendEvents: true"

       xemacs will accept events if you set a built-in  variable.
       The following was taken from the online help:

          `x-allow-sendevents' is a built-in boolean variable.

          Value: t

          Documentation:

          *Non-nil  means  to  allow synthetic events.  Nil means
          they are ignored.

          Beware: allowing emacs to process  SendEvents  opens  a
          big security hole.

          In order to allow events you have to evaluate this lisp
          code (press Meta-x and enter the following expression):

                (setq x-allow-sendevents t)

          Placing this line into your .xemacs-options file should
          have the same result.

       If you have problems sending  events  please  drop  me  an
       email.
