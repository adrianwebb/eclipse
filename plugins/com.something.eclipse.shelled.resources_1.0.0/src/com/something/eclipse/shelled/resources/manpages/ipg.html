<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>ipg</B> is not a program, it is script which should be sourced
       to <B>bash</B>. When sourced it loads module <I>pg3</I>  and  exports  a
       few  of  functions  accessible  from  parent  shell. These
       macros are <B>pg</B> to start packet injection  and  to  get  the
       results of run; and <B>pgset</B> to setup packet generator.

       <B>pgset</B> can send the following commands to module <I>pg3</I>:


</PRE>
<H2>COMMAND</H2><PRE>
       <B>odev</B> <I>DEVICE</I>
              Name of Ethernet device to test. See warning below.

       <B>pkt_size</B> <I>BYTES</I>
              Size of packet to generate. The size  includes  all
              the headers: UDP, IP, MAC, but does not account for
              overhead internal to medium, i.e. FCS  and  various
              paddings.

       <B>frags</B> <I>NUMBER</I>
              Each packet will contain <I>NUMBER</I> of fragments.  Max­
              imal amount for linux-2.4 is 6.  Far  not  all  the
              devices support fragmented buffers.

       <B>count</B> <I>NUMBER</I>
              Send  stream  of  <I>NUMBER</I>  of packets and stop after
              this.

       <B>ipg</B> <I>TIME</I>
              Introduce artificial delay between packets of  <I>TIME</I>
              microseconds.

       <B>dst</B> <I>IP</I><B>_</B><I>ADDRESS</I>
              Select  IP destination where the stream is sent to.
              Beware, never set this address at  random.  <B>pg3</B>  is
              not  a toy, it creates really tough stream. Default
              value is 0.0.0.0.

       <B>dst</B> <I>MAC</I><B>_</B><I>ADDRESS</I>
              Select MAC destination where the stream is sent to.
              Default  value  is  00:00:00:00:00:00  in hope that
              this will not be received by any node on LAN.


</PRE>
<H2>SECURITY</H2><PRE>
       This can be used only by superuser.

       This  tool  creates floods of packets which is unlikely to
       be handled even by high-end machines. For example, it sat­
       urates  gigabit  link  with 60 byte packets when used with
       Intel's e1000. In face of such  stream  switches,  routers
       and  end  hosts may deadlock, crash, explode.  Use only in
       test lab environment.

<H2>AVAILABILITY</H2><PRE>
       <B>pg3</B> is part of <I>iputils</I> package and the latest versions are
       available    in    source    form    for   anonymous   ftp
       ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/iputils-current.tar.gz.
