<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>grodvi</B> [ <B>-dv</B> ] [ <B>-w</B><I>n</I> ] [ <B>-F</B><I>dir</I> ] [ <I>files</I>...  ]

       It  is  possible to have whitespace between a command line
       option and its parameter.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>grodvi</B> is a driver for <B>groff</B> that produces TeX dvi format.
       Normally  it  should be run by <B>groff</B> <B>-Tdvi</B>.  This will run
       <B>troff</B> <B>-Tdvi</B>;   it   will    also    input    the    macros
       <B>/usr/share/groff/1.17.2/tmac/dvi.tmac</B>;  if  the  input  is
       being  preprocessed  with   <B>eqn</B>   it   will   also   input
       <B>/usr/share/groff/1.17.2/font/devdvi/eqnchar</B>.

       The  dvi  file  generated  by <B>grodvi</B> can be printed by any
       correctly-written dvi driver.  The  troff  drawing  primi­
       tives  are  implemented using the tpic version 2 specials.
       If the driver does not support these, the <B>\D</B> commands will
       not produce any output.

       There is an additional drawing command available:

       <B>\D'R</B> <I>dh</I> <I>dv</I><B>'</B>
              Draw  a rule (solid black rectangle), with one cor­
              ner at the current  position,  and  the  diagonally
              opposite  corner  at the current position +(<I>dh</I>,<I>dv</I>).
              Afterwards the current  position  will  be  at  the
              opposite  corner.   This produces a rule in the dvi
              file and so can be printed even with a driver  that
              does not support the tpic specials unlike the other
              <B>\D</B> commands.

       The groff command <B>\X'</B><I>anything</I><B>'</B> is translated into the same
       command  in  the  dvi  file  as would be produced by <B>\spe­</B>
       <B>cial{</B><I>anything</I><B>}</B> in TeX; <I>anything</I> <I>may</I> <I>not</I> <I>contain</I> <I>a</I> <I>newline.</I>

       Font  files for <B>grodvi</B> can be created from tfm files using
       <B>tfmtodit(1)</B>.  The font description file should contain the
       following additional commands:

       <B>internalname</B> <I>name</I>
                     The  name  of the tfm file (without the <B>.tfm</B>
                     extension) is <I>name</I>.

       <B>checksum</B> <I>n</I>    The checksum in the tfm file is <I>n</I>.

       <B>designsize</B> <I>n</I>  The designsize in the tfm file is <I>n</I>.

       These are automatically generated by <B>tfmtodit.</B>

       In <B>troff</B> the <B>\N</B> escape sequence  can  be  used  to  access
       characters  by  their  position  in  the corresponding tfm
       <B>-F</B><I>dir</I>  Prepend directory <I>dir</I><B>/devdvi</B> to the search path for
              font and device description files.

<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>
       <B>/usr/share/groff/1.17.2/font/devdvi/DESC</B>
              Device description file.

       <B>/usr/share/groff/1.17.2/font/devdvi/</B><I>F</I>
              Font description file for font <I>F</I>.

       <B>/usr/share/groff/1.17.2/tmac/dvi.tmac</B>
              Macros for use with <B>grodvi</B>.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       Dvi files produced by <B>grodvi</B> use  a  different  resolution
       (57816  units  per inch) to those produced by TeX.  Incor­
       rectly written drivers which assume the resolution used by
       TeX, rather than using the resolution specified in the dvi
       file will not work with <B>grodvi</B>.

       When using the <B>-d</B> option with boxed tables,  vertical  and
       horizontal  lines  can  sometimes  protrude  by one pixel.
       This is a consequence of the way  TeX  requires  that  the
       heights and widths of rules be rounded.
