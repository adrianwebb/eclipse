<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>hpftodit</B> [ <B>-sv</B> ] [ <B>-i</B><I>n</I> ] <I>tfm</I><B>_</B><I>file</I> <I>map</I><B>_</B><I>file</I> <I>font</I>

       It is possible to have whitespace between the  <B>-i</B>  command
       line option and its parameter.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>hpftodit</B> creates a font file for use with <B>groff</B> <B>-Tlj4</B> from
       an HP tagged font metric file.  <I>tfm</I><B>_</B><I>file</I> is  the  name  of
       the  tagged  font metric file for the font.  <I>map</I><B>_</B><I>file</I> is a
       file giving the groff names for characters  in  the  font;
       this  file  should  consist  of a sequence of lines of the
       form:

              <I>n</I> <I>c1</I> <I>c2</I> ...

       where <I>n</I> is a decimal integer giving the MSL number of  the
       character,  and  <I>c1</I>,  <I>c2</I>,...   are  the groff names of the
       character.  <I>font</I> is the name of the groff font file.   The
       groff font file is written to <I>font</I>.

       The  <B>-s</B>  option  should be given if the font is special (a
       font is <I>special</I> if <B>troff</B> should search it whenever a char­
       acter  is  not found in the current font.)  If the font is
       special, it should be listed in the <B>fonts</B> command  in  the
       DESC  file; if it is not special, there is no need to list
       it, since <B>troff</B> can automatically mount it when it's first
       used.

       If the <B>-i</B> option is used, <B>hpftodit</B> will automatically gen­
       erate an italic correction, a left italic correction and a
       subscript  correction for each character (the significance
       of these parameters is explained in <B>groff_font(5)</B>).

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-v</B>     Print the version number.

       <B>-s</B>     The font is special.  The effect of this option  is
              to add the <B>special</B> command to the font file.

       <B>-i</B><I>n</I>    Generate an italic correction for each character so
              that the character's  width  plus  the  character's
              italic  correction  is equal to <I>n</I> design units plus
              the amount by which the right edge of  the  charac­
              ter's  bounding  is to the right of the character's
              origin.  If this would result in a negative  italic
              correction,  use  a zero italic correction instead.
              There are 8782 design units per em for  Intellifont
              fonts.

              Also  generate  a subscript correction equal to the

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       This  program was written without the benefit of complete,
       official documentation on the tagged font  metric  format.
       It  is  therefore  likely that it will fail to work on tfm
       files that are dissimilar to those for the internal  fonts
       on the Laserjet 4, with which it was tested:

       TrueType tfm files are not supported.
