<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>perldoc</I> looks up a piece of documentation in .pod format
       that is embedded in the perl installation tree or in a
       perl script, and displays it via "pod2man | nroff -man |
       $PAGER". (In addition, if running under HP-UX, "col -x"
       will be used.) This is primarily used for the documenta­
       tion for the perl library modules.

       Your system may also have man pages installed for those
       modules, in which case you can probably just use the
       <B>man(1)</B> command.

       If you are looking for a table of contents to the Perl
       library modules documentation, see the perltoc page.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-h</B> help
            Prints out a brief help message.

       <B>-v</B> verbose
            Describes search for the item in detail.

       <B>-t</B> text output
            Display docs using plain text converter, instead of
            nroff. This may be faster, but it won't look as nice.

       <B>-u</B> unformatted
            Find docs only; skip reformatting by pod2*

       <B>-m</B> module
            Display the entire module: both code and unformatted
            pod documentation.  This may be useful if the docs
            don't explain a function in the detail you need, and
            you'd like to inspect the code directly; perldoc will
            find the file for you and simply hand it off for dis­
            play.

       <B>-l</B> file name only
            Display the file name of the module found.

       <B>-F</B> file names
            Consider arguments as file names, no search in direc­
            tories will be performed.

            file "$Config{archlib}/pod.idx".  The pod.idx file
            should contain fully qualified filenames, one per
            line.

       <B>-U</B> run insecurely
            Because <B>perldoc</B> does not run properly tainted, and is
            known to have security issues, it will not normally
            execute as the superuser.  If you use the <B>-U</B> flag, it
            will do so, but only after setting the effective and
            real IDs to nobody's or nouser's account, or -2 if
            unavailable.  If it cannot relinquish its privileges,
            it will not run.

       <B>PageName|ModuleName|ProgramName</B>
            The item you want to look up.  Nested modules (such
            as "File::Basename") are specified either as
            "File::Basename" or "File/Basename".  You may also
            give a descriptive name of a page, such as "perl­
            func".


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
       Any switches in the "PERLDOC" environment variable will be
       used before the command line arguments.  "perldoc" also
       searches directories specified by the "PERL5LIB" (or "PER­
       LLIB" if "PERL5LIB" is not defined) and "PATH" environment
       variables.  (The latter is so that embedded pods for exe­
       cutables, such as "perldoc" itself, are available.)
       "perldoc" will use, in order of preference, the pager
       defined in "PERLDOC_PAGER", "MANPAGER", or "PAGER" before
       trying to find a pager on its own.  ("MANPAGER" is not
       used if "perldoc" was told to display plain text or unfor­
       matted pod.)

       One useful value for "PERLDOC_PAGER" is "less -+C -E".
