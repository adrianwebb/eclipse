<H2>Note of warning</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation, and may  not  be  entirely
       accurate  or  complete.   See the end of this man page for
       details.

<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       The mcd command is  used  to  change  the  mtools  working
       directory  on  the MS-DOS disk. It uses the following syn­
       tax:


          mcd [<I>msdosdirectory</I>]



       Without arguments, mcd  reports  the  current  device  and
       working  directory.   Otherwise,  mcd  changes the current
       device and current working directory relative to an MS-DOS
       filesystem.

       The  environmental variable MCWD may be used to locate the
       file where the device and current working directory infor­
       mation is stored.  The default is `$HOME/.mcwd'.  Informa­
       tion in this file is ignored if the file is  more  than  6
       hours old.

       Mcd returns 0 on success or 1 on failure.

       Unlike MS-DOS versions of CD, mcd can be used to change to
       another device. It may be wise to remove old `.mcwd' files
       at logout.

<H2>Viewing the texi doc</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this  process  is
       only  approximative,  and  some items, such as crossrefer­
       ences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  translation
       process.   Indeed,  these items have no appropriate repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I strongly advise you to use  the  original  texinfo  doc.
       See  the  end of this manpage for instructions how to view
       the texinfo doc.


       *      To  generate  an  info copy (browsable using emacs'
              info mode), run:

                     <B>./configure;</B> <B>make</B> <B>info</B>



       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.
       Indeed, in the info version certain examples are difficult
       to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
