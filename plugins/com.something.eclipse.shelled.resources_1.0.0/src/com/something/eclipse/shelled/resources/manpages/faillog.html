<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>faillog</B> [<B>-u</B> <I>login-name</I>] [<B>-a</B>] [<B>-t</B> <I>days</I>]
               [<B>-m</B> <I>max</I>] [<B>-pr</B>]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>faillog</B>   formats   the   contents  of  the  failure  log,
       <I>/var/log/faillog</I>, and maintains failure counts and limits.
       The  order  of  the  arguments  to <B>faillog</B> is significant.
       Each argument is processed immediately in the order given.

       The  <B>-p</B>  flag  causes failure entries to be printed in UID
       order.  Entering <B>-u</B> <I>login-name</I> flag will cause the failure
       record  for  <I>login-name</I>  only  to be printed.  Entering <B>-t</B>
       <I>days</I> will cause only the failures more recent than <I>days</I> to
       be  printed.  The <B>-t</B> flag overrides the use of <B>-u</B>.  The <B>-a</B>
       flag causes all users to be selected.  When used with  the
       <B>-p</B> flag, this option selects all users who have ever had a
       login failure.  It is meaningless with the <B>-r</B> flag.

       The <B>-r</B> flag is used to reset the count of login  failures.
       Write  access  to  <I>/var/log/faillog</I>  is  required for this
       option.  Entering <B>-u</B> <I>login-name</I> will cause only the  fail­
       ure count for <I>login-name</I> to be reset.

       The  <B>-m</B>  flag  is  used to set the maximum number of login
       failures before the account is disabled.  Write access  to
       <I>/var/log/faillog</I> is required for this option.  Entering <B>-m</B>
       <I>max</I> will cause all  accounts  to  be  disabled  after  <I>max</I>
       failed  logins occur.  This may be modified with <B>-u</B> <I>login-</I>
       <I>name</I> to limit this function to <I>login-name</I> only.  Selecting
       a  <I>max</I> value of 0 has the effect of not placing a limit on
       the number of failed logins.  The  maximum  failure  count
       should  always  be  0 for <B>root</B> to prevent a denial of ser­
       vices attack against the system.

       Options may be combined in virtually  any  fashion.   Each
       <B>-p</B>, <B>-r</B>, and <B>-m</B> option will cause immediate execution using
       any <B>-u</B> or <B>-t</B> modifier.


</PRE>
<H2>CAVEATS</H2><PRE>
       <B>faillog</B> only prints out users  with  no  successful  login
       since the last failure.  To print out a user who has had a
       successful  login  since  their  last  failure,  you  must
       explicitly request the user with the <B>-u</B> flag, or print out
       all users with the <B>-a</B> flag.

       Some  systems  may  replace  /var/log  with  /var/adm   or
       /usr/adm.
