<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This  manual  page describes the GNU version of <B>eqn</B>, which
       is part of the groff document formatting system.  <B>eqn</B> com­
       piles  descriptions  of  equations  embedded  within <B>troff</B>
       input files into commands that are  understood  by  <B>troff</B>.
       Normally,  it  should  be  invoked  using the <B>-e</B> option of
       <B>groff</B>.  The syntax is quite compatible with Unix eqn.  The
       output  of GNU eqn cannot be processed with Unix troff; it
       must be processed with GNU troff.  If no files  are  given
       on  the  command line, the standard input will be read.  A
       filename of <B>-</B> will cause the standard input to be read.

       <B>eqn</B> searches for the file <B>eqnrc</B> in the  directories  given
       with  the  <B>-M</B>  option  first, then in <B>/usr/lib/groff/site-</B>
       <B>tmac</B>, <B>/usr/share/groff/site-tmac</B>, and finally in the stan­
       dard  macro directory <B>/usr/share/groff/1.17.2/tmac</B>.  If it
       exists, eqn will process it before the other input  files.
       The <B>-R</B> option prevents this.

       GNU  eqn  does  not  provide the functionality of neqn: it
       does not support low-resolution,  typewriter-like  devices
       (although it may work adequately for very simple input).

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-C</B>     Recognize <B>.EQ</B> and <B>.EN</B> even when followed by a char­
              acter other than space or newline.

       <B>-N</B>     Don't  allow  newlines  within  delimiters.    This
              option  allows  <B>eqn</B>  to recover better from missing
              closing delimiters.

       <B>-v</B>     Print the version number.

       <B>-r</B>     Only one size reduction.

       <B>-m</B><I>n</I>    The minimum point-size is <I>n</I>.  eqn will  not  reduce
              the size of subscripts or superscripts to a smaller
              size than <I>n</I>.

       <B>-T</B><I>name</I> The output is for device <I>name</I>.  The only effect  of
              this  is  to define a macro <I>name</I> with a value of <B>1</B>.
              Typically <B>eqnrc</B> will use this  to  provide  defini­
              tions  appropriate  for  the  output  device.   The
              default output device is <B>ps</B>.

              This option is deprecated.  Normally eqn makes sets
              subscripts  and  superscripts at 70% of the size of
              the surrounding text.

<H2>USAGE</H2><PRE>
       Only the differences between GNU  eqn  and  Unix  eqn  are
       described here.

       Most  of  the  new  features  of GNU eqn are based on TeX.
       There are some references to the differences  between  TeX
       and  GNU  eqn below; these may safely be ignored if you do
       not know TeX.

   <B>Automatic</B> <B>spacing</B>
       <B>eqn</B> gives each  component  of  an  equation  a  type,  and
       adjusts  the  spacing  between components using that type.
       Possible types are:

       ordinary     an ordinary character such as 1 or <I>x</I>;

       operator     a large operator such as <I>¯</I<B>></B>;

       binary       a binary operator such as +;

       relation     a relation such as =;

       opening      a opening bracket such as (;

       closing      a closing bracket such as );

       punctuation  a punctuation character such as ,;

       inner        a subformula contained within brackets;

       suppress     spacing  that  suppresses  automatic  spacing
                    adjustment.

       Components of an equation get a type in one of two ways.

       <B>type</B> <I>t</I> <I>e</I>
              This  yields  an equation component that contains <I>e</I>
              but that has type <I>t</I>, where <I>t</I> is one  of  the  types
              mentioned above.  For example, <B>times</B> is defined as

                     <B>type</B> <B>"binary"</B> <B>\(mu</B>

              The name of the type doesn't have to be quoted, but
              quoting protects from macro expansion.

       <B>chartype</B> <I>t</I> <I>text</I>
              Unquoted groups of characters  are  split  up  into
              individual characters, and the type of each charac­
              This is similar to <B>over</B>; <B>smallover</B> reduces the size
              of  <I>e1</I>  and  <I>e2</I>;  it  also puts less vertical space
              between <I>e1</I> or <I>e2</I> and the fraction  bar.   The  <B>over</B>
              primitive corresponds to the TeX <B>\over</B> primitive in
              display styles; <B>smallover</B> corresponds to  <B>\over</B>  in
              non-display styles.

       <B>vcenter</B> <I>e</I>
              This vertically centers <I>e</I> about the math axis.  The
              math axis is  the  vertical  position  about  which
              characters such as + and - are centered; also it is
              the vertical position used for  the  bar  of  frac­
              tions.  For example, <B>sum</B> is defined as

                     <B>{</B> <B>type</B> <B>"operator"</B> <B>vcenter</B> <B>size</B> <B>+5</B> <B>\(*S</B> <B>}</B>

       <I>e1</I> <B>accent</B> <I>e2</I>
              This  sets  <I>e2</I> as an accent over <I>e1</I>.  <I>e2</I> is assumed
              to be at the correct height for a lowercase letter;
              <I>e2</I>  will be moved down according if <I>e1</I> is taller or
              shorter than a lowercase letter.  For example,  <B>hat</B>
              is defined as

                     <B>accent</B> <B>{</B> <B>"^"</B> <B>}</B>

              <B>dotdot</B>,  <B>dot</B>,  <B>tilde</B>, <B>vec</B> and <B>dyad</B> are also defined
              using the <B>accent</B> primitive.

       <I>e1</I> <B>uaccent</B> <I>e2</I>
              This sets <I>e2</I> as an accent under <I>e1</I>.  <I>e2</I> is  assumed
              to be at the correct height for a character without
              a descender; <I>e2</I> will be moved  down  if  <I>e1</I>  has  a
              descender.   <B>utilde</B> is pre-defined using <B>uaccent</B> as
              a tilde accent below the baseline.

       <B>split</B> <B>"</B><I>text</I><B>"</B>
              This has the same effect as simply

                     <I>text</I>

              but <I>text</I> is not subject to macro expansion  because
              it is quoted; <I>text</I> will be split up and the spacing
              between individual characters will be adjusted.

       <B>nosplit</B> <I>text</I>
              This has the same effect as

                     <B>"</B><I>text</I><B>"</B>

              but because <I>text</I> is not quoted it will  be  subject
              to  macro  expansion; <I>text</I> will not be split up and
              the spacing between individual characters will  not

       <B>special</B> <I>text</I> <I>e</I>
              This  constructs  a  new  object  from  <I>e</I>  using  a
              <B>troff(1)</B> macro  named  <I>text</I>.   When  the  macro  is
              called,  the  string <B>0s</B> will contain the output for
              <I>e</I>, and the number registers <B>0w</B>, <B>0h</B>, <B>0d</B>, <B>0skern</B>  and
              <B>0skew</B>  will  contain the width, height, depth, sub­
              script kern, and skew of <I>e</I>.  (The <I>subscript</I> <I>kern</I> of
              an  object says how much a subscript on that object
              should be tucked in; the <I>skew</I> of an object says how
              far  to  the  right  of the center of the object an
              accent over the  object  should  be  placed.)   The
              macro  must  modify  <B>0s</B>  so that it will output the
              desired result  with  its  origin  at  the  current
              point, and increase the current horizontal position
              by the width of the object.  The  number  registers
              must  also  be  modified so that they correspond to
              the result.

              For example, suppose you wanted  a  construct  that
              `cancels'  an expression by drawing a diagonal line
              through it.

                     <B>.EQ</B>
                     <B>define</B> <B>cancel</B> <B>'special</B> <B>Ca'</B>
                     <B>.EN</B>
                     <B>.de</B> <B>Ca</B>
                     <B>.ds</B> <B>0s</B> <B>\Z'\\*(0s'\v'\\n(0du'\D'l</B> <B>\\n(0wu</B> <B>-\\n(0hu-\\n(0du'\v'\\n(0hu'</B>
                     <B>..</B>

              Then you could cancel an  expression  <I>e</I>  with  <B>can­</B>
              <B>cel</B> <B>{</B> <I>e</I> <B>}</B>

              Here's  a  more  complicated construct that draws a
              box round an expression:

                     <B>.EQ</B>
                     <B>define</B> <B>box</B> <B>'special</B> <B>Bx'</B>
                     <B>.EN</B>
                     <B>.de</B> <B>Bx</B>
                     <B>.ds</B> <B>0s</B> <B>\Z'\h'1n'\\*(0s'\</B>
                     <B>\Z'\v'\\n(0du+1n'\D'l</B> <B>\\n(0wu+2n</B> <B>0'\D'l</B> <B>0</B> <B>-\\n(0hu-\\n(0du-2n'\</B>
                     <B>\D'l</B> <B>-\\n(0wu-2n</B> <B>0'\D'l</B> <B>0</B> <B>\\n(0hu+\\n(0du+2n''\h'\\n(0wu+2n'</B>
                     <B>.nr</B> <B>0w</B> <B>+2n</B>
                     <B>.nr</B> <B>0d</B> <B>+1n</B>
                     <B>.nr</B> <B>0h</B> <B>+1n</B>
                     <B>..</B>

   <B>Customization</B>
       The appearance of equations is controlled by a large  num­
       ber of parameters. These can be set using the <B>set</B> command.

              <B>minimum_size</B>            <B>eqn</B>  will  not set anything
                                      at  a  smaller   point-size
                                      than this.  The value is in
                                      points.

              <B>fat_offset</B>              The <B>fat</B> primitive emboldens
                                      an equation by overprinting
                                      two copies of the  equation
                                      horizontally offset by this
                                      amount.

              <B>over_hang</B>               A  fraction  bar  will   be
                                      longer by twice this amount
                                      than  the  maximum  of  the
                                      widths of the numerator and
                                      denominator;    in    other
                                      words, it will overhang the
                                      numerator  and  denominator
                                      by at least this amount.

              <B>accent_width</B>            When   <B>bar</B>   or   <B>under</B>  is
                                      applied to a single charac­
                                      ter,  the line will be this
                                      long.   Normally,  <B>bar</B>   or
                                      <B>under</B> produces a line whose
                                      length is the width of  the
                                      object to which it applies;
                                      in the  case  of  a  single
                                      character,  this  tends  to
                                      produce a line  that  looks
                                      too long.

              <B>delimiter_factor</B>        Extensible  delimiters pro­
                                      duced  with  the  <B>left</B>  and
                                      <B>right</B>  primitives will have
                                      a combined height and depth
                                      of at least this many thou­
                                      sandths of twice the  maxi­

                                      sub-equation    that    the
                                      delimiters  enclose extends
                                      away from the axis.

              <B>delimiter_shortfall</B>     Extensible delimiters  pro­
                                      duced  with  the  <B>left</B>  and
                                      <B>right</B> primitives will  have
                                      a combined height and depth
                                      not less than  the  differ­
                                      ence  of  twice the maximum
                                      amount by  which  the  sub-

                                      iters enclose extends  away

                                      is   important   that  this

              <B>default_rule_thickness</B>  This   should  set  to  the

              <B>num1</B>                    The <B>over</B> command will shift

                                      least this amount.

              <B>num2</B>                    The <B>smallover</B> command  will
                                      shift  up  the numerator by
                                      at least this amount.

              <B>denom1</B>                  The <B>over</B> command will shift
                                      down  the denominator by at

              <B>denom2</B>                  The <B>smallover</B> command  will
                                      shift  down the denominator
                                      by at least this amount.

              <B>sup1</B>                    Normally superscripts  will
                                      be  shifted  up by at least
                                      this amount.

                                      this amount.

              <B>sub2</B>                    When  there  is both a sub­

                                      the   subscript   will   be
                                      shifted down  by  at  least

              <B>big_op_spacing5</B>         This  much  vertical  space
                                      will  be  added  above  and
                                      below limits.

              <B>baseline_sep</B>            The  baselines  of the rows
                                      in a pile  or  matrix  will
                                      normally be this far apart.
                                      In most cases  this  should

                                      added  at  each  side  of a
                                      matrix.

              <B>draw_lines</B>              If this is non-zero,  lines
                                      will  be drawn using the <B>\D</B>
                                      escape   sequence,   rather
                                      than  with  the  <B>\l</B>  escape
                                      sequence and the <B>\(ru</B> char­
                                      acter.

              <B>body_height</B>             The  amount  by  which  the
                                      height  of   the   equation
                                      exceeds  this will be added
                                      as extra space  before  the
                                      line  containing  the equa­
                                      tion   (using   <B>\x</B>.)    The
                                      default value is 85.

              <B>body_depth</B>              The  amount  by  which  the
                                      depth   of   the   equation
                                      exceeds  this will be added
                                      as extra  space  after  the
                                      line  containing  the equa­
                                      tion   (using   <B>\x</B>.)    The
                                      default value is 35.

              <B>nroff</B>                   If  this  is non-zero, then
                                      <B>ndefine</B>  will  behave  like
                                      <B>define</B>  and <B>tdefine</B> will be
                                      ignored, otherwise  <B>tdefine</B>
                                      will behave like <B>define</B> and
                                      <B>ndefine</B>  will  be  ignored.
                                      The   default  value  is  0
                                      (This is typically  changed
                                      to  1 by the <B>eqnrc</B> file for
                                      the  <B>ascii</B>,  <B>latin1</B>,  <B>utf8</B>,
                                      and <B>cp1047</B> devices.)

              A  more  precise description of the role of many of
              these parameters can be  found  in  Appendix  H  of
              <I>The</I> <I>TeXbook</I>.

   <B>Macros</B>
       Macros can take arguments.  In a macro body, <B>$</B><I>n</I> where <I>n</I> is
       between 1 and 9, will be replaced by the <I>n-th</I> argument  if
       the  macro  is  called  with arguments; if there are fewer
       than <I>n</I> arguments, it will be replaced by nothing.  A  word
       containing  a  left parenthesis where the part of the word
       before the left parenthesis has  been  defined  using  the
       <B>define</B>  command  will  be  recognized as a macro call with
              If  <I>name</I>  has  been  defined by <B>define</B> (or has been
              automatically defined because <I>name</I>  is  the  output
              device)  process  <I>anything</I>;  otherwise  ignore <I>any­</I>
              <I>thing</I>.  <I>X</I> can be any  character  not  appearing  in
              <I>anything</I>.

   <B>Fonts</B>
       <B>eqn</B>  normally  uses at least two fonts to set an equation:
       an italic font for letters, and a roman  font  for  every­
       thing  else.   The existing <B>gfont</B> command changes the font
       that is used as the italic font.  By default  this  is  <B>I</B>.
       The  font  that  is  used as the roman font can be changed
       using the new <B>grfont</B> command.

       <B>grfont</B> <I>f</I>
              Set the roman font to <I>f</I>.

       The <B>italic</B> primitive uses the current italic font  set  by
       <B>gfont</B>; the <B>roman</B> primitive uses the current roman font set
       by <B>grfont</B>.  There is also  a  new  <B>gbfont</B>  command,  which
       changes  the font used by the <B>bold</B> primitive.  If you only
       use the <B>roman</B>, <B>italic</B> and <B>bold</B> primitives to changes fonts
       within  an  equation, you can change all the fonts used by
       your equations just by using <B>gfont</B>, <B>grfont</B> and <B>gbfont</B> com­
       mands.

       You  can  control  which characters are treated as letters
       (and therefore set in italics) by using the <B>chartype</B>  com­
       mand described above.  A type of <B>letter</B> will cause a char­
       acter to be set in italic type.   A  type  of  <B>digit</B>  will
       cause a character to be set in roman type.
