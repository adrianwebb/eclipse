         piconv [-f from_encoding] [-t to_encoding] [-s string] [files...]
         piconv -l


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>piconv</B> is perl version of <B>iconv</B>, a character encoding con­
       verter widely available for various Unixen today.  This
       script was primarily a technology demonstrator for Perl
       5.8.0, but you can use piconv in the place of iconv for
       virtually any case.

       piconv converts the character encoding of either STDIN or
       files specified in the argument and prints out to STDOUT.

       Here is the  list of options.

       -f from_encoding
           Specifies the encoding you are converting from.
           Unlike <B>iconv</B>, this option can be omitted.  In such
           cases, the current locale is used.

       -t to_encoding
           Specifies the encoding you are converting to.  Unlike
           <B>iconv</B>, this option can be omitted.  In such cases, the
           current locale is used.

           Therefore, when both -f and -t are omitted, <B>piconv</B>
           just acts like <B>cat</B>.

       -s <I>string</I>
           uses <I>string</I> instead of file for the source of text.
           Same as <B>iconv</B>.

       -l  Lists all available encodings, one per line, in case-
           insensitive order.  Note that only the canonical names
           are listed; many aliases exist.  For example, the
           names are case-insensitive, and many standard and com­
           mon aliases work, such as "latin1" for "ISO-8859-1",
           or "ibm850" instead of "cp850", or "winlatin1" for
           "cp1252".  See Encode::Supported for a full discus­
           sion.

       -C <I>N</I>
           Check the validity of the stream if <I>N</I> = 1.  When <I>N</I> =
           -1, something interesting happens when it encounters
           an invalid character.

       -c  Same as "-C 1".

       -p  Same as "-C -1".

       -h  Show usage.

           perlio
               The new perlIO layer is used.  NI-S' favorite.

           Like the <I>-D</I> option, this is also for Encode hackers.
