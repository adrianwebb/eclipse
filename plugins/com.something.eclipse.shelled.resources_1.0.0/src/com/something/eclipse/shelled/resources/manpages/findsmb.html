<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>findsmb</B> [ <B>subnet</B> <B>broadcast</B> <B>address</B> ]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This perl script is part of the  Samba suite.

       <B>findsmb</B> is a perl script that prints out several pieces of
       information about machines on a subnet that respond to SMB
       name query requests.  It uses  <B>nmblookup(1)</B> to obtain this
       information.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>subnet</B> <B>broadcast</B> <B>address</B>
              Without  this option, <B>findsmb</B> will probe the subnet
              of the machine where <B>findsmb</B> is run. This value  is
              passed to <B>nmblookup</B> as part of the -B option


</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
       The  output of <B>findsmb</B> lists the following information for
       all machines that respond to the initial <B>nmblookup</B> for any
       name:  IP address, NetBIOS name, Workgroup name, operating
       system, and SMB server version.

       There will be a '+' in front of  the  workgroup  name  for
       machines  that  are  local  master browsers for that work­
       group. There will be an '*' in front of the workgroup name
       for  machines  that are the domain master browser for that
       workgroup.  Machines that are running Windows, Windows  95
       or  Windows  98  will  not  show any information about the
       operating system or server version.

       The command must be run on a system without <B>nmbd</B>  running.
       If <B>nmbd</B> is running on the system, you will only get the IP
       address and the DNS name of the  machine.  To  get  proper
       responses  from  Windows  95  and Windows 98 machines, the
       command must be run as root.

       For example running <B>findsmb</B> on a machine without <B>nmbd</B> run­
       ning would yield output similar to the following

       IP ADDR         NETBIOS NAME   WORKGROUP/OS/VERSION

       created  by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the
       Samba Team as an Open Source project similar  to  the  way
       the Linux kernel is developed.

       The  original  Samba  man pages were written by Karl Auer.
       The  man  page  sources  were  converted  to  YODL  format
       (another  excellent  piece of Open Source software, avail­
       able          at           ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/
       &lt;URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/&gt;) and updated for the
       Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy  Allison.  The  conversion  to
       DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
