       version III release alpha 9.8 (02 Mar 2001)


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>cdparanoia</B> [<B>options</B>] <B>span</B> [<B>outfile</B>]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>cdparanoia</B> retrieves audio tracks from CDDA capable  CDROM
       drives.   The  data  can be saved to a file or directed to
       standard output in WAV, AIFF, AIFF-C or raw format.   Most
       ATAPI,  SCSI and several proprietary CDROM drive makes are
       supported; <B>cdparanoia</B> can determine if the target drive is
       CDDA capable.

       In  addition  to  simple  reading,  <B>cdparanoia</B> adds extra-
       robust data verification, synchronization, error  handling
       and scratch reconstruction capability.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-v</B> <B>--verbose</B>
              Be absurdly verbose about the autosensing and read­
              ing process. Good for setup and debugging.


       <B>-q</B> <B>--quiet</B>
              Do not print any progress or error information dur­
              ing the reading process.


       <B>-e</B> <B>--stderr-progress</B>
              Force output of progress information to stderr (for
              wrapper scripts).


       <B>-V</B> <B>--version</B>
              Print the program version and quit.


       <B>-Q</B> <B>--query</B>
              Perform CDROM drive autosense, query and print  the
              CDROM table of contents, then quit.


       <B>-s</B> <B>--search-for-drive</B>
              Forces a complete search for a cdrom drive, even if
              the /dev/cdrom link exists.


       <B>-h</B> <B>--help</B>
              Print a brief  synopsis  of  <B>cdparanoia</B>  usage  and
              options.

       <B>-R</B> <B>--output-raw-big-endian</B>
              Output  headerless data as raw 16 bit PCM data with
              interleaved samples in MSB first byte order.


       <B>-w</B> <B>--output-wav</B>
              Output data in Micro$oft RIFF WAV format (note that
              WAV data is always LSB first byte order).


       <B>-f</B> <B>--output-aiff</B>
              Output  data  in  Apple AIFF format (note that AIFC
              data is always in MSB first byte order).


       <B>-a</B> <B>--output-aifc</B>
              Output data in  uncompressed  Apple  AIFF-C  format
              (note  that AIFF-C data is always in MSB first byte
              order).


       <B>-B</B> <B>--batch</B>

              Cdda2wav-style batch output flag;  cdparanoia  will
              split  the  output  into  multiple  files  at track
              boundaries.  Output file names are  prepended  with
              'track#.'


       <B>-c</B> <B>--force-cdrom-little-endian</B>
              Some CDROM drives misreport their endianness (or do
              not report it at all); it's possible  that  cdpara­
              noia  will guess wrong.  Use <B>-c</B> to force cdparanoia
              to treat the drive as a little endian device.


       <B>-C</B> <B>--force-cdrom-big-endian</B>
              As above but force cdparanoia to treat the drive as
              a big endian device.


       <B>-n</B> <B>--force-default-sectors</B> <I>n</I>
              Force the interface backend to do atomic reads of <B>n</B>
              sectors per read.  This number can  be  misleading;
              the kernel will often split read requests into mul­
              tiple atomic reads (the automated Paranoia code  is
              aware   of  this)  or  allow  reads  only  wihin  a
              restricted size range.  <B>This</B> <B>option</B>  <B>should</B>  <B>gener­</B>
              <B>ally</B> <B>not</B> <B>be</B> <B>used.</B>


       <B>-d</B> <B>--force-cdrom-device</B> <I>device</I>
              Use this option explicitly to set the read rate  of
              the  CD  drive  (where supported).  This can reduce
              underruns on machines with slow disks, or which are
              low on memory.


       <B>-t</B> <B>--toc-offset</B> <I>number</I>
              Use  this  option  to  force  the  entire  disc LBA
              addressing to shift by the given amount; the  value
              is added to the beginning offsets in the TOC.  This
              can be used to shift track boundaries for the whole
              disc  manually  on  sector  granularity.   The next
              option does something similar...


       <B>-T</B> <B>--toc-bias</B>
              Some drives (usually random  Toshibas)  report  the
              actual  track  beginning  offset values in the TOC,
              but then treat the beginning of track 1 index 1  as
              sector  0 for all read operations.  This results in
              every track seeming to start too late (losing a bit
              of  the  beginning  and  catching a bit of the next
              track).  <B>-T</B> accounts for this behavior.  Note  that
              this  option  will  cause  cdparanoia to attempt to
              read sectors before or past  the  known  user  data
              area  of the disc, resulting in read errors at disc
              edges on most drives and possibly even hard lockups
              on some buggy hardware.


       <B>-O</B> <B>--sample-offset</B> <I>number</I>
              Use  this  option to force the entire disc to shift
              sample position output by the  given  amount;  This
              can be used to shift track boundaries for the whole
              disc manually on sample granularity. Note that this
              will  cause  cdparanoia  to attempt to read partial
              sectors before or past the known user data area  of
              the  disc,  probably  causing  read  errors on most
              drives and possibly even hard lockups on some buggy
              hardware.



       <B>-Z</B> <B>--disable-paranoia</B>
              Disable  <B>all</B>  data verification and correction fea­
              tures.   When  using  -Z,  cdparanoia  reads   data
              exactly  as  would cdda2wav with an overlap setting
              of zero.  This option implies that <B>-Y</B> is active.


       <B>-z</B> <B>--never-skip[=max_retries]</B>
              Do not accept any skips; retry forever  if  needed.
              whatever,  abort  reading this track.  If output is
              to a file, delete the partially completed file.

          <B>V</B>   Uncorrected error/skip



</PRE>
<H2>SPAN ARGUMENT</H2><PRE>
       The span argument specifies which track, tracks or subsec­
       tions  of  tracks  to  read.   This  argument is required.
       <B>NOTE:</B> Unless the span is a simple number, it's generally a
       good  idea  to  quote the span argument to protect it from
       the shell.

       When only a single offset is supplied, it  is  interpreted
       as  a starting offset and ripping will continue to the end
       of the track.  If a single offset is preceeded or followed
       by  a  hyphen,  the implicit missing offset is taken to be
       the start or end of the disc, respectively. Thus:


       <B>1:[20.35]</B>
              Specifies ripping from track 1, second  20,  sector
              35 to the end of track 1.

       <B>1:[20.35]-</B>
              Specifies  ripping  from 1[20.35] to the end of the
              disc

       <B>-2</B>     Specifies ripping from the beginning of the disc up
              to (and including) track 2

       <B>-2:[30.35]</B>
              Specifies ripping from the beginning of the disc up
              to 2:[30.35]

       <B>2-4</B>    Specifies ripping from the beginning of track 2  to
              the end of track 4.

       Again,  don't  forget  to protect square brackets and pre­
       ceeding hyphens from the shell.



</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
       A few examples, protected from the shell:

       Query only with exhaustive search for  a  drive  and  full
       reporting of autosense:

              cdparanoia -vsQ

       Extract an entire disc, putting each track in  a  seperate
       file:

              cdparanoia -B

       Extract from track 1, time 0:30.12 to 1:10.00:

              cdparanoia "1[:30.12]-1[1:10]"

       Extract from the beginning of the disc up to track 3:

              cdparanoia -- "-3"

       The "--" above is to distinguish "-3" from an option flag.


       Joerg  Schilling  has  also  contributed  SCSI   expertise
       through his generic SCSI transport library.
