<H2>Note of warning</H2><PRE>
       This  manpage  has  been  automatically   generated   from
       mtools's  texinfo  documentation,  and may not be entirely
       accurate or complete.  See the end of this  man  page  for
       details.

<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       The  mkmanifest  command  is used to create a shell script
       (packing list) to restore Unix filenames. Its syntax is:

       mkmanifest [ <I>files</I> ]

       Mkmanifest  creates  a  shell  script  that  aids  in  the
       restoration  of  Unix  filenames that got clobbered by the
       MS-DOS  filename  restrictions.   MS-DOS   filenames   are
       restricted  to  8 character names, 3 character extensions,
       upper case only, no device names, and no  illegal  charac­
       ters.

       The mkmanifest program is compatible with the methods used
       in pcomm, arc, and mtools to change  perfectly  good  Unix
       filenames  to fit the MS-DOS restrictions. This command is
       only useful if the  target  system  which  will  read  the
       diskette cannot handle vfat long names.



</PRE>
<H2>Example</H2><PRE>
       You  want  to  copy  the  following Unix files to a MS-DOS
       diskette (using the mcopy command).


            <B>very_long_name</B>
            <B>2.many.dots</B>
            <B>illegal:</B>
            <B>good.c</B>
            <B>prn.dev</B>
            <B>Capital</B>



       Mcopy converts the names to:


            <B>very_lon</B>
            <B>2xmany.dot</B>
            <B>illegalx</B>
            <B>good.c</B>
            <B>xprn.dev</B>
            <B>mv</B> <B>capital</B> <B>Capital</B>



       Notice that "good.c" did not require any conversion, so it
       did not appear in the output.

       Suppose  I've  copied  these  files  from  the diskette to
       another Unix system, and I now  want  the  files  back  to
       their  original names.  If the file "manifest" (the output
       captured above) was sent along with those files, it  could
       be used to convert the filenames.



</PRE>
<H2>Bugs</H2><PRE>
       The  short  names  generated  by mkmanifest follow the old
       convention (from mtools-2.0.7) and not the one  from  Win­
       dows 95 and mtools-3.0.

<H2>Viewing the texi doc</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this  process  is
       only  approximative,  and  some items, such as crossrefer­
       ences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  translation
       process.   Indeed,  these items have no appropriate repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I strongly advise you to use  the  original  texinfo  doc.
       See  the  end of this manpage for instructions how to view
       the texinfo doc.
