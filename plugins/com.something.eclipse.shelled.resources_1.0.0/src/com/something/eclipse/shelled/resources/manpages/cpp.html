<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The C preprocessor, often known as <I>cpp</I>, is a <I>macro</I> <I>proces­</I>
       <I>sor</I> that is used automatically by the C compiler to trans­
       form your program before compilation.  It is called a
       macro processor because it allows you to define <I>macros</I>,
       which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.

       The C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C,
       C++, and Objective-C source code.  In the past, it has
       been abused as a general text processor.  It will choke on
       input which does not obey C's lexical rules.  For example,
       apostrophes will be interpreted as the beginning of char­
       acter constants, and cause errors.  Also, you cannot rely
       on it preserving characteristics of the input which are
       not significant to C-family languages.  If a Makefile is
       preprocessed, all the hard tabs will be removed, and the
       Makefile will not work.

       Having said that, you can often get away with using cpp on
       things which are not C.  Other Algol-ish programming lan­
       guages are often safe (Pascal, Ada, etc.) So is assembly,
       with caution.  <B>-traditional-cpp</B> mode preserves more white
       space, and is otherwise more permissive.  Many of the
       problems can be avoided by writing C or C++ style comments
       instead of native language comments, and keeping macros
       simple.

       Wherever possible, you should use a preprocessor geared to
       the language you are writing in.  Modern versions of the
       GNU assembler have macro facilities.  Most high level pro­
       gramming languages have their own conditional compilation
       and inclusion mechanism.  If all else fails, try a true
       general text processor, such as GNU M4.

       C preprocessors vary in some details.  This manual dis­
       cusses the GNU C preprocessor, which provides a small
       superset of the features of ISO Standard C.  In its
       default mode, the GNU C preprocessor does not do a few
       things required by the standard.  These are features which
       are rarely, if ever, used, and may cause surprising
       changes to the meaning of a program which does not expect


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The C preprocessor expects two file names as arguments,
       <I>infile</I> and <I>outfile</I>.  The preprocessor reads <I>infile</I>
       together with any other files it specifies with <B>#include</B>.
       All the output generated by the combined input files is
       written in <I>outfile</I>.

       Either <I>infile</I> or <I>outfile</I> may be <B>-</B>, which as <I>infile</I> means
       to read from standard input and as <I>outfile</I> means to write
       to standard output.  Also, if either file is omitted, it
       means the same as if <B>-</B> had been specified for that file.

       Unless otherwise noted, or the option ends in <B>=</B>, all
       options which take an argument may have that argument
       appear either immediately after the option, or with a
       space between option and argument: <B>-Ifoo</B> and <B>-I</B> <B>foo</B> have
       the same effect.

       Many options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple
       single-letter options may <I>not</I> be grouped: <B>-dM</B> is very dif­
       ferent from <B>-d</B> <B>-M</B>.

       <B>-D</B> <I>name</I>
           Predefine <I>name</I> as a macro, with definition 1.

       <B>-D</B> <I>name</I><B>=</B><I>definition</I>
           Predefine <I>name</I> as a macro, with definition <I>definition</I>.
           There are no restrictions on the contents of <I>defini­</I>
           <I>tion</I>, but if you are invoking the preprocessor from a
           shell or shell-like program you may need to use the
           shell's quoting syntax to protect characters such as
           spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.

           If you wish to define a function-like macro on the
           command line, write its argument list with surrounding
           parentheses before the equals sign (if any).  Paren­
           theses are meaningful to most shells, so you will need
           to quote the option.  With <B>sh</B> and <B>csh</B>,
           <B>-D'</B><I>name</I><B>(</B><I>args...</I><B>)=</B><I>definition</I><B>'</B> works.

           <B>-D</B> and <B>-U</B> options are processed in the order they are
           given on the command line.  All <B>-imacros</B> <I>file</I> and
           <B>-include</B> <I>file</I> options are processed after all <B>-D</B> and
           <B>-U</B> options.

       <B>-U</B> <I>name</I>
           Cancel any previous definition of <I>name</I>, either built
           in or provided with a <B>-D</B> option.

       <B>-undef</B>
           Do not predefine any system-specific macros.  The com­
           Write output to <I>file</I>.  This is the same as specifying
           <I>file</I> as the second non-option argument to <B>cpp</B>.  <B>gcc</B>
           has a different interpretation of a second non-option
           argument, so you must use <B>-o</B> to specify the output
           file.

       <B>-Wall</B>
           Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for
           normal code.  At present this is <B>-Wcomment</B> and <B>-Wtri­</B>
           <B>graphs</B>.  Note that many of the preprocessor's warnings
           are on by default and have no options to control them.

       <B>-Wcomment</B>
       <B>-Wcomments</B>
           Warn whenever a comment-start sequence <B>/*</B> appears in a
           <B>/*</B> comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in
           a <B>//</B> comment.  (Both forms have the same effect.)

       <B>-Wtrigraphs</B>
           Warn if any trigraphs are encountered.  This option
           used to take effect only if <B>-trigraphs</B> was also speci­
           fied, but now works independently.  Warnings are not
           given for trigraphs within comments, as they do not
           affect the meaning of the program.

       <B>-Wtraditional</B>
           Warn about certain constructs that behave differently
           in traditional and ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C con­
           structs that have no traditional C equivalent, and
           problematic constructs which should be avoided.

       <B>-Wimport</B>
           Warn the first time <B>#import</B> is used.

       <B>-Wundef</B>
           Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro is
           encountered in an <B>#if</B> directive, outside of <B>defined</B>.
           Such identifiers are replaced with zero.

       <B>-Wunused-macros</B>
           Warn about macros defined in the main file that are
           unused.  A macro is <I>used</I> if it is expanded or tested
           for existence at least once.  The preprocessor will
           also warn if the macro has not been used at the time
           it is redefined or undefined.

           Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line,
           and macros defined in include files are not warned
           about.

           <B>Note:</B> If a macro is actually used, but only used in
           skipped conditional blocks, then CPP will report it as
                   #if FOO
                   ...
                   #else FOO
                   ...
                   #endif FOO

           The second and third "FOO" should be in comments, but
           often are not in older programs.  This warning is on
           by default.

       <B>-Werror</B>
           Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which
           triggers warnings will be rejected.

       <B>-Wsystem-headers</B>
           Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are
           normally unhelpful in finding bugs in your own code,
           therefore suppressed.  If you are responsible for the
           system library, you may want to see them.

       <B>-w</B>  Suppress all warnings, including those which GNU CPP
           issues by default.

       <B>-pedantic</B>
           Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C
           standard.  Some of them are left out by default, since
           they trigger frequently on harmless code.

       <B>-pedantic-errors</B>
           Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all
           mandatory diagnostics into errors.  This includes
           mandatory diagnostics that GCC issues without <B>-pedan­</B>
           <B>tic</B> but treats as warnings.

       <B>-M</B>  Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing,
           output a rule suitable for <B>make</B> describing the depen­
           dencies of the main source file.  The preprocessor
           outputs one <B>make</B> rule containing the object file name
           for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
           the included files, including those coming from
           <B>-include</B> or <B>-imacros</B> command line options.

           Unless specified explicitly (with <B>-MT</B> or <B>-MQ</B>), the
           object file name consists of the basename of the
           source file with any suffix replaced with object file
           suffix.  If there are many included files then the
           rule is split into several lines using <B>\</B>-newline.  The
           rule has no commands.

           This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug
           output, such as <B>-dM</B>.  To avoid mixing such debug out­
           put with the dependency rules you should explicitly
           ble quotes in an <B>#include</B> directive does not in itself
           determine whether that header will appear in <B>-MM</B>
           dependency output.  This is a slight change in seman­
           tics from GCC versions 3.0 and earlier.

       <B>-MF</B> <I>file</I>
           @anchor{-MF} When used with <B>-M</B> or <B>-MM</B>, specifies a
           file to write the dependencies to.  If no <B>-MF</B> switch
           is given the preprocessor sends the rules to the same
           place it would have sent preprocessed output.

           When used with the driver options <B>-MD</B> or <B>-MMD</B>, <B>-MF</B>
           overrides the default dependency output file.

       <B>-MG</B> In conjunction with an option such as <B>-M</B> requesting
           dependency generation, <B>-MG</B> assumes missing header
           files are generated files and adds them to the depen­
           dency list without raising an error.  The dependency
           filename is taken directly from the "#include" direc­
           tive without prepending any path.  <B>-MG</B> also suppresses
           preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders
           this useless.

           This feature is used in automatic updating of make­
           files.

       <B>-MP</B> This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for
           each dependency other than the main file, causing each
           to depend on nothing.  These dummy rules work around
           errors <B>make</B> gives if you remove header files without
           updating the <I>Makefile</I> to match.

           This is typical output:

                   test.o: test.c test.h

                   test.h:

       <B>-MT</B> <I>target</I>
           Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency
           generation.  By default CPP takes the name of the main
           input file, including any path, deletes any file suf­
           fix such as <B>.c</B>, and appends the platform's usual
           object suffix.  The result is the target.

           An <B>-MT</B> option will set the target to be exactly the
           string you specify.  If you want multiple targets, you
           can specify them as a single argument to <B>-MT</B>, or use
           multiple <B>-MT</B> options.

           For example, <B>-MT</B> <B>'$(objpfx)foo.o'</B> might give

           uses its argument but with a suffix of <I>.d</I>, otherwise
           it take the basename of the input file and applies a
           <I>.d</I> suffix.

           If <B>-MD</B> is used in conjunction with <B>-E</B>, any <B>-o</B> switch
           is understood to specify the dependency output file
           (but @pxref{-MF}), but if used without <B>-E</B>, each <B>-o</B> is
           understood to specify a target object file.

           Since <B>-E</B> is not implied, <B>-MD</B> can be used to generate a
           dependency output file as a side-effect of the compi­
           lation process.

       <B>-MMD</B>
           Like <B>-MD</B> except mention only user header files, not
           system -header files.

       <B>-x</B> <B>c</B>
       <B>-x</B> <B>c++</B>
       <B>-x</B> <B>objective-c</B>
       <B>-x</B> <B>assembler-with-cpp</B>
           Specify the source language: C, C++, Objective-C, or
           assembly.  This has nothing to do with standards con­
           formance or extensions; it merely selects which base
           syntax to expect.  If you give none of these options,
           cpp will deduce the language from the extension of the
           source file: <B>.c</B>, <B>.cc</B>, <B>.m</B>, or <B>.S</B>.  Some other common
           extensions for C++ and assembly are also recognized.
           If cpp does not recognize the extension, it will treat
           the file as C; this is the most generic mode.

           <B>Note:</B> Previous versions of cpp accepted a <B>-lang</B> option
           which selected both the language and the standards
           conformance level.  This option has been removed,
           because it conflicts with the <B>-l</B> option.

       <B>-std=</B><I>standard</I>
       <B>-ansi</B>
           Specify the standard to which the code should conform.
           Currently CPP knows about C and C++ standards; others
           may be added in the future.

           <I>standard</I> may be one of:

           "iso9899:1990"
           "c89"
               The ISO C standard from 1990.  <B>c89</B> is the custom­
               ary shorthand for this version of the standard.

               The <B>-ansi</B> option is equivalent to <B>-std=c89</B>.

           "iso9899:199409"
           "gnu9x"
               The 1999 C standard plus GNU extensions.

           "c++98"
               The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus amendments.

           "gnu++98"
               The same as <B>-std=c++98</B> plus GNU extensions.  This
               is the default for C++ code.

       <B>-I-</B> Split the include path.  Any directories specified
           with <B>-I</B> options before <B>-I-</B> are searched only for head­
           ers requested with "#include "file""; they are not
           searched for "#include &lt;file&gt;".  If additional direc­
           tories are specified with <B>-I</B> options after the <B>-I-</B>,
           those directories are searched for all <B>#include</B> direc­
           tives.

           In addition, <B>-I-</B> inhibits the use of the directory of
           the current file directory as the first search direc­
           tory for "#include "file"".

       <B>-nostdinc</B>
           Do not search the standard system directories for
           header files.  Only the directories you have specified
           with <B>-I</B> options (and the directory of the current
           file, if appropriate) are searched.

       <B>-nostdinc++</B>
           Do not search for header files in the C++-specific
           standard directories, but do still search the other
           standard directories.  (This option is used when
           building the C++ library.)

       <B>-include</B> <I>file</I>
           Process <I>file</I> as if "#include "file"" appeared as the
           first line of the primary source file.  However, the
           first directory searched for <I>file</I> is the preproces­
           sor's working directory <I>instead</I> <I>of</I> the directory con­
           taining the main source file.  If not found there, it
           is searched for in the remainder of the "#include
           "..."" search chain as normal.

           If multiple <B>-include</B> options are given, the files are
           included in the order they appear on the command line.

       <B>-imacros</B> <I>file</I>
           Exactly like <B>-include</B>, except that any output produced
           by scanning <I>file</I> is thrown away.  Macros it defines
           remain defined.  This allows you to acquire all the
           macros from a header without also processing its dec­
           larations.

       <B>-iwithprefix</B> <I>dir</I>
       <B>-iwithprefixbefore</B> <I>dir</I>
           Append <I>dir</I> to the prefix specified previously with
           <B>-iprefix</B>, and add the resulting directory to the
           include search path.  <B>-iwithprefixbefore</B> puts it in
           the same place <B>-I</B> would; <B>-iwithprefix</B> puts it where
           <B>-idirafter</B> would.

           Use of these options is discouraged.

       <B>-isystem</B> <I>dir</I>
           Search <I>dir</I> for header files, after all directories
           specified by <B>-I</B> but before the standard system direc­
           tories.  Mark it as a system directory, so that it
           gets the same special treatment as is applied to the
           standard system directories.

       <B>-fpreprocessed</B>
           Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has
           already been preprocessed.  This suppresses things
           like macro expansion, trigraph conversion, escaped
           newline splicing, and processing of most directives.
           The preprocessor still recognizes and removes com­
           ments, so that you can pass a file preprocessed with
           <B>-C</B> to the compiler without problems.  In this mode the
           integrated preprocessor is little more than a tok­
           enizer for the front ends.

           <B>-fpreprocessed</B> is implicit if the input file has one
           of the extensions <B>.i</B>, <B>.ii</B> or <B>.mi</B>.  These are the
           extensions that GCC uses for preprocessed files cre­
           ated by <B>-save-temps</B>.

       <B>-ftabstop=</B><I>width</I>
           Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the
           preprocessor report correct column numbers in warnings
           or errors, even if tabs appear on the line.  If the
           value is less than 1 or greater than 100, the option
           is ignored.  The default is 8.

       <B>-fno-show-column</B>
           Do not print column numbers in diagnostics.  This may
           be necessary if diagnostics are being scanned by a
           program that does not understand the column numbers,
           such as <B>dejagnu</B>.

       <B>-A</B> <I>predicate</I><B>=</B><I>answer</I>
           Make an assertion with the predicate <I>predicate</I> and
           answer <I>answer</I>.  This form is preferred to the older
           form <B>-A</B> <I>predicate</I><B>(</B><I>answer</I><B>)</B>, which is still supported,
           because it does not use shell special characters.
           Other characters are interpreted by the compiler
           proper, or reserved for future versions of GCC, and so
           are silently ignored.  If you specify characters whose
           behavior conflicts, the result is undefined.

           <B>M</B>   Instead of the normal output, generate a list of
               <B>#define</B> directives for all the macros defined dur­
               ing the execution of the preprocessor, including
               predefined macros.  This gives you a way of find­
               ing out what is predefined in your version of the
               preprocessor.  Assuming you have no file <I>foo.h</I>,
               the command

                       touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h

               will show all the predefined macros.

           <B>D</B>   Like <B>M</B> except in two respects: it does <I>not</I> include
               the predefined macros, and it outputs <I>both</I> the
               <B>#define</B> directives and the result of preprocess­
               ing.  Both kinds of output go to the standard out­
               put file.

           <B>N</B>   Like <B>D</B>, but emit only the macro names, not their
               expansions.

           <B>I</B>   Output <B>#include</B> directives in addition to the
               result of preprocessing.

       <B>-P</B>  Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from
           the preprocessor.  This might be useful when running
           the preprocessor on something that is not C code, and
           will be sent to a program which might be confused by
           the linemarkers.

       <B>-C</B>  Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed
           through to the output file, except for comments in
           processed directives, which are deleted along with the
           directive.

           You should be prepared for side effects when using <B>-C</B>;
           it causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens
           in their own right.  For example, comments appearing
           at the start of what would be a directive line have
           the effect of turning that line into an ordinary
           source line, since the first token on the line is no
           longer a <B>#</B>.

       <B>-CC</B> Do not discard comments, including during macro expan­
           sion.  This is like <B>-C</B>, except that comments contained
           within macros are also passed through to the output
           file where the macro is expanded.
           case with <B>-no-gcc</B>.

       <B>-traditional-cpp</B>
           Try to imitate the behavior of old-fashioned C prepro­
           cessors, as opposed to ISO C preprocessors.

       <B>-trigraphs</B>
           Process trigraph sequences.

       <B>-remap</B>
           Enable special code to work around file systems which
           only permit very short file names, such as MS-DOS.

       <B>--help</B>
       <B>--target-help</B>
           Print text describing all the command line options
           instead of preprocessing anything.

       <B>-v</B>  Verbose mode.  Print out GNU CPP's version number at
           the beginning of execution, and report the final form
           of the include path.

       <B>-H</B>  Print the name of each header file used, in addition
           to other normal activities.  Each name is indented to
           show how deep in the <B>#include</B> stack it is.

       <B>-version</B>
       <B>--version</B>
           Print out GNU CPP's version number.  With one dash,
           proceed to preprocess as normal.  With two dashes,
           exit immediately.

<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
       This section describes the environment variables that
       affect how CPP operates.  You can use them to specify
       directories or prefixes to use when searching for include
       files, or to control dependency output.

       Note that you can also specify places to search using
       options such as <B>-I</B>, and control dependency output with
       options like <B>-M</B>.  These take precedence over environment
       variables, which in turn take precedence over the configu­
       ration of GCC.

       <B>CPATH</B>
       <B>C_INCLUDE_PATH</B>
       <B>CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH</B>
       <B>OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH</B>
           Each variable's value is a list of directories sepa­
           rated by a special character, much like <B>PATH</B>, in which
           to look for header files.  The special character,
           "PATH_SEPARATOR", is target-dependent and determined
           with <B>-isystem</B> options on the command line.

           In all these variables, an empty element instructs the
           compiler to search its current working directory.
           Empty elements can appear at the beginning or end of a
           path.  For instance, if the value of <B>CPATH</B> is ":/spe­
           cial/include", that has the same effect as <B>-I.</B> <B>-I/spe­</B>
           <B>cial/include</B>.

       <B>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</B>
           If this variable is set, its value specifies how to
           output dependencies for Make based on the non-system
           header files processed by the compiler.  System header
           files are ignored in the dependency output.

           The value of <B>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</B> can be just a file
           name, in which case the Make rules are written to that
           file, guessing the target name from the source file
           name.  Or the value can have the form <I>file</I> <I>target</I>, in
           which case the rules are written to file <I>file</I> using
           <I>target</I> as the target name.

           In other words, this environment variable is equiva­
           lent to combining the options <B>-MM</B> and <B>-MF</B>, with an
           optional <B>-MT</B> switch too.

       <B>SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES</B>
           This variable is the same as <B>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</B> (see
           above), except that system header files are not
           ignored, so it implies <B>-M</B> rather than <B>-MM</B>.  However,
           the dependence on the main input file is omitted.
