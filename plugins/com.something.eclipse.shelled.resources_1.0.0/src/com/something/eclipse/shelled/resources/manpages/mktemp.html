<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <B>mktemp</B> utility takes the given file name template and overwrites a
     portion of it to create a file name.  This file name is unique and suit­
     able for use by the application.  The template may be any file name with
     exactly six of `Xs' appended to it, for example <I>/tmp/temp.XXXXXX</I>.  The
     trailing six `Xs' are replaced with the current process number and/or a
     unique letter combination.  The number of unique file names <B>mktemp</B> can
     return are roughly 26 ** 6 combinations.

     If <B>mktemp</B> can successfully generate a unique file name, the file is cre­
     ated with mode 0600 (unless the <B>-u</B> flag is given) and the filename is
     printed to standard output.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     The available options are as follows:

     <B>-d</B>      Make a directory instead of a file.

     <B>-q</B>      Fail silently if an error occurs.  This is useful if a script
             does not want error output to go to standard error.

     <B>-u</B>      Operate in ``unsafe'' mode.  The temp file will be unlinked
             before <B>mktemp</B> exits.  This is slightly better than <B>mktemp(3)</B> but
             still introduces a race condition.  Use of this option is not
             encouraged.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUES</H2><PRE>
     The <B>mktemp</B> utility exits with a value of 0 on success, and 1 on failure.


</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
     The following <B>sh(1)</B> fragment illustrates a simple use of <B>mktemp</B> where the
     script should quit if it cannot get a safe temporary file.

           TMPFILE=`mktemp /tmp/$0.XXXXXX` || exit 1
           echo "program output" &gt;&gt; $TMPFILE

     In this case, we want the script to catch the error itself.

           TMPFILE=`mktemp -q /tmp/$0.XXXXXX`
           if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
                   echo "$0: Can't create temp file, exiting..."
                   exit 1
           fi

     Note that one can also check to see that $TMPFILE is zero length instead
     of checking $?.  This would allow the check to be done later one in the
     script (since $? would get clobbered by the next shell command).
