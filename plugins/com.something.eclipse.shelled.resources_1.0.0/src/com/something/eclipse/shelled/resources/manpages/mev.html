<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>mev</B> [ <I>options</I> ]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  `mev' program is part of the gpm package.  The infor­
       mation below is extracted from the texinfo file, which  is
       the preferred source of information.


       The  mev program is modeled after xev. It prints to stdout
       the mouse console events it gets.


       mev's default behaviour is to get  anything,  but  command
       line switches can be used to set the various fields in the
       Gpm_Connect structure, in order to customize the program's
       behaviour.  I'm using mev to handle mouse events to Emacs.


       Command line switches for mev are the following:

       -C <B>number</B>
              Select a virtual console to get events from.   This
              is intended to be used for debugging.

       -d <B>number</B>
              Choose  a  default mask. By default the server gets
              any events not belonging to  the  event  mask.  The
              mask can be provided either as a decimal number, or
              as a symbolic string.

       -e <B>number</B>
              Choose the event mask.  By  default  any  event  is
              received. The mask can be provided either as a dec­
              imal number, or as a symbolic string.

       -E     Enter emacs mode. In emacs mode events are reported
              as lisp forms rather than numbers. This is the for­
              mat used by the t-mouse package within emacs.

       -f     Fit events inside the screen before reporting them.
              This options re-fits drag events, which are allowed
              to exit the screen border,


       -i     Interactive. Accepts input  from  stdin  to  change
              connection parameters.

       -m <B>number</B>
              Choose  the  minimum  modifier mask. Any event with
              fewer modifiers will not be  reported  to  mev.  It
              defaults to 0.  The mask must be provided either as

       When the arguments are not decimal integers, they are con­
       sidered  lists  of alphanumeric characters, separated by a
       single non-alphanumeric character. I use  the  comma  (,),
       but any will do.


       Allowed names for events are move, drag, down or press, up
       or release, motion (which is  both  move  and  drag),  and
       hard.


       Allowed  names for modifiers are shift, leftAlt, rightAlt,
       anyAlt (one or the other), control.


       When the -i switch is specified, mev looks at its standard
       input as command lines rather than events. The input lines
       are parsed, and the commands push and pop are  recognized.


       The push command, then, accepts the options -d, -e, -m and
       -M, with the same  meaning  described  above.  Unspecified
       options  retain the previous value and the resulting masks
       are used to reopen the connection with the server. pop  is
       used  to  pop  the  connection stack. If an empty stack is
       popped the program exits.


       Other commands recognized are info,  used  to  return  the
       stack  depth;  quit  to prematurely terminate the program;
       and snapshot to get some  configuration  information  from
       the server.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       Beginning  with  release  1.16,  <B>mev</B> no longer works under
       xterm.  Please use the <B>rmev</B> program (provided in the  <B>sam­</B>
       <B>ple</B>  directory)  to  watch gpm events under xterm or rxvt.
       <B>rmev</B> also displays keyboard events besides mouse events.
