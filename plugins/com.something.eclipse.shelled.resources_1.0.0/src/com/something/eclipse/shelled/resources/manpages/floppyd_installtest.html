<H2>Note of warning</H2><PRE>
       This  manpage  has  been  automatically   generated   from
       mtools's  texinfo  documentation,  and may not be entirely
       accurate or complete.  See the end of this  man  page  for
       details.

<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       Floppyd_installtest is used to check for the presence of a
       running floppyd daemon. This is usefull,  if  you  have  a
       small  frontend script to mtools, which decides whether to
       use floppyd or not.

       floppyd_installtest [-f]  Connect-String

       If the -f option is specified, floppyd_installtest does  a
       full  X-Cookie  authentication  and complains if this does
       not work.

       The connect-String has the format described in  the  flop­
       pyd-section: <I>hostname</I>:<I>displaynumber</I>[/<I>baseport</I>]

<H2>Viewing the texi doc</H2><PRE>
       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this  process  is
       only  approximative,  and  some items, such as crossrefer­
       ences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  translation
       process.   Indeed,  these items have no appropriate repre­
       sentation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all infor­
       mation has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus
       I strongly advise you to use  the  original  texinfo  doc.
       See  the  end of this manpage for instructions how to view
       the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo  doc,
