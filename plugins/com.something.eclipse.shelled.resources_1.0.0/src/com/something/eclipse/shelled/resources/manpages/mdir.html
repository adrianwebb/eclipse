       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation, and may  not  be  entirely
       accurate  or  complete.   See the end of this man page for

<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       The mdir command is used to display an  MS-DOS  directory.
       Its syntax is:

       mdir [-/] [-f] [-w] [-a] [-b] <I>msdosfile</I> [ <I>msdosfiles</I>...]

       Mdir  displays  the contents of MS-DOS directories, or the
       entries for some MS-DOS files.

       Mdir supports the following command line options:

       /      Recursive output, just like Dos' -s option

       w      Wide output.  With this  option,  mdir  prints  the
              filenames  across  the  page without displaying the
              file size or creation date.

       a      Also list hidden files.

       f      Fast.  Do not try  to  find  out  free  space.   On
              larger  disks, finding out the amount of free space
              takes up some non trivial amount of  time,  as  the
              whole FAT must be read in and scanned.  The -f flag
              bypasses this step.  This flag  is  not  needed  on
              FAT32    filesystems,    which   store   the   size
              explicitely.

       b      Concise listing. Lists each directory name or file­
              name,  one  per line (including the filename exten­
              sion). This switch displays no heading  information
              and  no  summary.  Only a newline separated list of
              pathnames is displayed.

       An error occurs if a component of the path is not a direc­
       tory.

       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     <B>./configure;</B> <B>make</B> <B>html</B>

              A     premade     html    can    be    found    at:
              `http://mtools.linux.lu'     and      also      at:
              `http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/mtools'

       *      To  generate  an  info copy (browsable using emacs'
              info mode), run:

                     <B>./configure;</B> <B>make</B> <B>info</B>



       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.
       Indeed, in the info version certain examples are difficult
       to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
