<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>mkzftree</B> [<I>OPTIONS</I>]... <I>INPUT</I> <I>OUTPUT</I>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Takes  an input file tree (<I>INPUT</I>) and create a correspond­
       ing compressed file tree (<I>OUTPUT</I>) that can be used with an
       appropriately  patched <B>mkisofs(8)</B> to create a transparent-
       compression iso9660/RockRidge filesystem  using  the  "ZF"
       compression records.

       <B>-f</B>, <B>--force</B>
              Always  compress all files, even if they get larger
              when compressed.

       <B>-z</B> <I>level</I>, <B>--level</B> <I>level</I>
              Select compression level (1-9, default is 9).

       <B>-u</B>, <B>--uncompress</B>
              Uncompress an already compressed tree.  This can be
              used  to  read  a compressed filesystem on a system
              which cannot read them natively.

       <B>-p</B> <I>parallelism</I>, <B>--parallelism</B> <I>parallelism</I>
              Compress in parallel.  The <I>parallelism</I> value  indi­
              cates  how  many compression threads are allowed to
              run.

       <B>-x</B>, <B>--one-filesystem</B>
              Do not  cross  filesystem  boundaries,  but  create
              directory stubs at mount points.

       <B>-X</B>, <B>--strict-one-filesystem</B>
              Do not cross filesystem boundaries, and do not cre­
              ate directory stubs at mount points.

       <B>-l</B>, <B>--local</B>
              Do not recurse into subdirectories, but create  the
              directories themselves.

       <B>-L</B>, <B>--strict-local</B>
              Do not recurse into subdirectories, and do not cre­
              ate directories.

       <B>-F</B>, <B>--file</B>
              Indicates that  <I>INPUT</I>  may  not  necessarily  be  a
              directory;  this allows operation on a single file.
              Note especially that if <I>-F</I> is specified, and  <I>INPUT</I>
              is  a  symlink,  the  symlink itself will be copied
              rather than whatever it happens to point to.

       <B>-s</B>, <B>--sloppy</B>
              Treat file modes, times and ownership data as  less
              Display a brief help message.

       <B>-w</B>, <B>--version</B>
              Display the release version.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       Long  options (beginning with <I>--</I>) may not work on all sys­
       tems.  See the message printed out by <I>mkzftree</I> <I>-h</I>  to  see
       if this applies to your system.

       Inode  change  times  (ctimes)  are not copied.  This is a
       system limitation and applies to all file copy programs.

       If  using  the  parallel  option  (<I>-z</I>)  the  access  times
       (atimes)  on  directories may or may not be copied.  If it
       is important that the atimes  on  directories  are  copied
       exactly, avoid using <I>-z</I>.
