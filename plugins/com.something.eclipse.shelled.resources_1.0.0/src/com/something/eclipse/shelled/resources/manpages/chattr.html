<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>chattr</B> [ <B>-RV</B> ] [ <B>-v</B> <I>version</I> ] [ <I>mode</I> ] <I>files...</I>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>chattr</B> changes the  file  attributes  on  a  Linux  second
       extended file system.

       The format of a symbolic mode is +-=[ASacDdistu].

       The  operator  `+'  causes  the  selected attributes to be
       added to the existing attributes of the files; `-'  causes
       them  to  be  removed;  and `=' causes them to be the only
       attributes that the files have.

       The letters `ASacDdijsu' select the new attributes for the
       files:  don't  update  atime (A), synchronous updates (S),
       synchronous directory updates (D), append only  (a),  com­
       pressed  (c), no dump (d), immutable (i), data journalling
       (j), secure deletion (s), and undeletable (u).


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-R</B>     Recursively change attributes  of  directories  and
              their  contents.  Symbolic links encountered during
              recursive directory traversals are ignored.

       <B>-V</B>     Be verbose with chattr's output and print the  pro­
              gram version.

       <B>-v</B> <I>version</I>
              Set the file's version/generation number.

<H2>ATTRIBUTES</H2><PRE>
       When  a  file  with the 'A' attribute set is accessed, its
       atime record is  not  modified.   This  avoids  a  certain
       amount of disk I/O for laptop systems.

       A  file  with  the  `a'  attribute set can only be open in
       append mode for writing.  Only the superuser  can  set  or
       clear this attribute.

       A  file  with  the `c' attribute set is automatically com­
       pressed on the disk by the kernel. A read from  this  file
       returns uncompressed data. A write to this file compresses
       data before storing them on the disk.

       When a directory with the `D' attribute set  is  modified,
       the changes are written synchronously on the disk; this is
       equivalent to the `dirsync' mount option applied to a sub­
       set of the files.

       A  file  with  the  `d' attribute set is not candidate for
       itself,  if   the   filesystem   is   mounted   with   the
       "data=ordered"  or  "data=writeback"  options.   When  the
       filesystem is mounted with  the  "data=journalled"  option
       all file data is already journalled and this attribute has
       no effect.

       When a file with the `s' attribute  set  is  deleted,  its
       blocks are zeroed and written back to the disk.

       When  a  file  with the `S' attribute set is modified, the
       changes are written synchronously on  the  disk;  this  is
       equivalent  to the `sync' mount option applied to a subset
       of the files.

       A file with the 't' attribute  will  not  have  a  partial
       block  fragment at the of the file merged with other files
       (for those filesystems which support tail-merging).   This
       is  necessary for applications such as LILO which read the
       filesystem directly, and who don't understand  tail-merged
       files.

       When  a  file  with  the `u' attribute set is deleted, its
       contents are saved.  This allows the user to ask  for  its
       undeletion.

       The  'X' attribute is used by the experimental compression
       patches to indicate that a raw contents  of  a  compressed
       file  can  be  accessed directly.  It currently may not be
       set or reset using <B>chattr(1)</B>, although it can be displayed
       by <B>lsattr(1)</B>.

       The  'Z' attribute is used by the experimental compression
       patches to indicate a compressed file is  dirty.   It  may
       not  be  set  or reset using <B>chattr(1)</B>, although it can be
       displayed by <B>lsattr(1)</B>.

<H2>BUGS AND LIMITATIONS</H2><PRE>
       As of Linux 2.2, the `c', 's',  and `u' attribute are  not
       honored by the kernel filesystem code.    These attributes
       will be implemented in a future ext2 fs version.

       The `j' option is only useful if the filesystem is mounted
       as ext3.

       The  `D'  option is only useful on Linux kernel 2.5.19 and
       later.
