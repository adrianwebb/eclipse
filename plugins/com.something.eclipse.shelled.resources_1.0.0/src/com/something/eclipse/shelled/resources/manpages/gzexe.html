<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>gzexe</B> [ name ...  ]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  <I>gzexe</I>  utility  allows you to compress executables in
       place and have them automatically uncompress  and  execute
       when  you  run  them  (at  a penalty in performance).  For
       example if you execute ``gzexe /bin/cat'' it  will  create
       the following two files:
           -r-xr-xr-x  1 root  bin   9644 Feb 11 11:16 /bin/cat
           -r-xr-xr-x  1 bin   bin  24576 Nov 23 13:21 /bin/cat~
       /bin/cat~  is  the original file and /bin/cat is the self-
       uncompressing executable file.  You can  remove  /bin/cat~
       once you are sure that /bin/cat works properly.

       This  utility  is  most  useful on systems with very small
       disks.

<H2>CAVEATS</H2><PRE>
       The compressed executable is a shell script. This may cre­
       ate some security holes.  In  particular,  the  compressed
       executable relies on the PATH environment variable to find
       <I>gzip</I> and some other utilities <I>(tail,</I> <I>chmod,</I> <I>ln,</I> <I>sleep).</I>


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       <I>gzexe</I> attempts to retain the original file  attributes  on
       the  compressed  executable,  but you may have to fix them
       manually in some cases, using <I>chmod</I> or <I>chown.</I>
