<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This tool is part of the  Samba suite.

       <B>make_smbcodepage</B>  compiles  or  de-compiles codepage files
       for use with the internationalization  features  of  Samba
       2.2


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>c|d</B>    This  tells <B>make_smbcodepage</B> if it is compiling (<I>c</I>)
              a text format code page file to binary, or (<I>d</I>)  de-
              compiling a binary codepage file to text.

       <B>codepage</B>
              This  is  the codepage we are processing (a number,
              e.g. 850).

       <B>inputfile</B>
              This is the input file to process. In  the  <I>c</I>  case
              this  will  be a text codepage definition file such
              as the ones found  in  the  Samba  <I>source/codepages</I>
              directory.  In  the  <I>d</I> case this will be the binary
              format codepage definition file normally  found  in
              the  <I>lib/codepages</I>  directory  in the Samba install
              directory path.

       <B>outputfile</B>
              This is the output file to produce.

<H2>SAMBA CODEPAGE FILES</H2><PRE>
       A text Samba codepage definition  file  is  a  description
       that  tells  Samba how to map from upper to lower case for
       characters greater than ascii 127  in  the  specified  DOS
       code  page.   Note that for certain DOS codepages (437 for
       example) mapping from lower to upper case may be  non-sym­
       metrical. For example, in code page 437 lower case a acute
       maps to a plain upper case A  when  going  from  lower  to
       upper  case,  but  plain  upper case A maps to plain lower
       case a when lower casing a character.

       A binary Samba codepage definition file is a binary repre­
       sentation  of the same information, including a value that
       specifies what codepage this file is describing.

       As Samba does not yet use UNICODE (current for Samba  ver­
       sion  2.2) you must specify the client code page that your
       DOS and Windows clients are using if you wish to have case
       insensitivity done correctly for your particular language.
       The default codepage Samba uses is 850 (Western European).
       Text  codepage definition sample files are provided in the
       <B>codepage_def.&lt;codepage&gt;</B>

       These are the input (text) codepage files provided in  the
       Samba <I>source/codepages</I> directory.

       A text codepage definition file consists of multiple lines
       containing four fields. These fields are:

       · <B>lower</B>: which is the (hex) lower case character mapped on
         this line.

       · <B>upper</B>:  which is the (hex) upper case character that the
         lower case character will map to.

       · <B>map</B> <B>upper</B> <B>to</B> <B>lower</B> which is a boolean value (put  either
         True  or  False  here) which tells Samba if it is to map
         the given upper case character to the given  lower  case
         character when lower casing a filename.

       · <B>map</B>  <B>lower</B> <B>to</B> <B>upper</B> which is a boolean value (put either
         True or False here) which tells Samba if it  is  to  map
         the  given  lower case character to the given upper case
         character when upper casing a filename.

       <B>codepage.&lt;codepage&gt;</B> - These are the output (binary)  code­
       page  files  produced  and placed in the Samba destination
       <I>lib/codepage</I> directory.

<H2>INSTALLATION</H2><PRE>
       The location of the server and its support files is a mat­
       ter  for  individual  system administrators. The following
       are thus suggestions only.

       It is recommended that  the  <B>make_smbcodepage</B>  program  be
       installed  under  the  <I>/usr/local/samba</I>  hierarchy,  in  a
       directory readable by all, writeable  only  by  root.  The
       program  itself  should  be executable by all. The program
       should NOT be setuid or setgid!


</PRE>
<H2>VERSION</H2><PRE>
       This man page is correct for  version  2.2  of  the  Samba
       suite.

<H2>AUTHOR</H2><PRE>
       The  original  Samba  software  and related utilities were
       created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by  the
       Samba  Team  as  an Open Source project similar to the way
       the Linux kernel is developed.
