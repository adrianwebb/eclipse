<H2>SYNTAX</H2><PRE>
       <B>mouse-test</B> [ <I>device</I> ... ]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This experimental and incomplete application tries to help
       in  detecting  which protocol does your mouse speak. It is
       able to detect MouseMan devices, and to choose between  -t
       ms  (three-buttons aware) and -t bare old two-buttons-only
       serial mice.




</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       I know the application is buggy, but I only own one  mouse
       device.   If  you are interested in this application, just
       call me and awake me from my laziness.



   <B>OPTIONS</B>
       <I>device</I> [ <I>device</I> ... ]

       Check this <I>device</I> for a mouse.  If no devices are  listed,
       mouse-test will try all possible devices.
