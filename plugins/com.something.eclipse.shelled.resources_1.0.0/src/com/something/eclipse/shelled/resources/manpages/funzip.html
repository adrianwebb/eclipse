<H2>ARGUMENTS</H2><PRE>
       [<I>-password</I>]
              Optional password to be  used  if  ZIP  archive  is
              encrypted.  Decryption may not be supported at some
              sites.  See DESCRIPTION for more details.

       [<I>input[.zip|.gz]</I>]
              Optional  input  archive  file  specification.  See
              DESCRIPTION for details.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>funzip</I>  without a file argument acts as a filter; that is,
       it assumes that a ZIP archive (or  a  <I>gzip</I>'<B>d(1)</B>  file)  is
       being piped into standard input, and it extracts the first
       member from the archive to stdout.  When stdin comes  from
       a  tty device, <I>funzip</I> assumes that this cannot be a stream
       of (binary) compressed data and shows a short  help  text,
       instead.   If there is a file argument, then input is read
       from the specified file instead of from stdin.

       A password for encrypted zip files can be specified on the
       command  line (preceding the file name, if any) by prefix­
       ing the password with a dash.  Note that this  constitutes
       a  security  risk  on many systems; currently running pro­
       cesses are often visible via simple commands (e.g.,  <B>ps(1)</B>
       under  Unix),  and command-line histories can be read.  If
       the first entry of the zip file is encrypted and no  pass­
       word  is  specified  on the command line, then the user is
       prompted for a password and the password is not echoed  on
       the console.

       Given  the  limitation on single-member extraction, <I>funzip</I>
       is most useful in conjunction with  a  secondary  archiver
       program such as <B>tar(1)</B>.  The following section includes an
       example illustrating this usage in the case of disk  back­
       ups to tape.

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
       To  use  <I>funzip</I>  to  extract  the first member file of the
       archive test.zip and to pipe it into <B>more(1)</B>:

           funzip test.zip | more

       To use <I>funzip</I> to test the first member  file  of  test.zip
       (any errors will be reported on standard error):

           funzip test.zip &gt; /dev/null

       and  <I>more</I>  then  ``restores''  the  terminal  to this mode
       before exiting.  To recover, run <I>funzip</I> on the  same  file
       but  redirect  to  /dev/null rather than piping into more;
       after prompting again for the password, <I>funzip</I> will  reset
       the terminal properly.

       There  is  presently  no way to extract any member but the
       first from a ZIP archive.  This would  be  useful  in  the
       case  where  a  ZIP  archive  is  included  within another
       archive.  In the case where the first member is  a  direc­
       tory, <I>funzip</I> simply creates the directory and exits.

       The  functionality  of  <I>funzip</I> should be incorporated into
       <I>unzip</I> itself (future release).
