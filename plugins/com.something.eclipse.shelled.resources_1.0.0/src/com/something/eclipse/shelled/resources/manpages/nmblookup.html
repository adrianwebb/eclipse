<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This tool is part of the  Samba suite.

       <B>nmblookup</B>  is  used to query NetBIOS names and map them to
       IP addresses  in  a  network  using  NetBIOS  over  TCP/IP
       queries. The options allow the name queries to be directed
       at a particular IP  broadcast  area  or  to  a  particular
       machine. All queries are done over UDP.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-f</B>     Causes  nmblookup to print out the flags in the NMB
              packet headers.  These  flags  will  print  out  as
              strings   like   Authoritative,  Recursion_Desired,
              Recursion_available, etc.

       <B>-M</B>     Searches for a master browser  by  looking  up  the
              NetBIOS  name <I>name</I> with a type of 0x1d. If  <I>name</I> is
              "-" then it does  a  lookup  on  the  special  name
              __MSBROWSE__.

       <B>-R</B>     Set the recursion desired bit in the packet to do a
              recursive lookup. This is used when sending a  name
              query  to  a  machine running a WINS server and the
              user wishes to query the names in the WINS  server.
              If this bit is unset the normal (broadcast respond­
              ing) NetBIOS processing code on a machine  is  used
              instead. See rfc1001, rfc1002 for details.

       <B>-S</B>     Once the name query has returned an IP address then
              do a node status query as well. A node status query
              returns the NetBIOS names registered by a host.

       <B>-r</B>     Try  and  bind  to UDP port 137 to send and receive
              UDP datagrams. The reason for this option is a  bug
              in  Windows  95 where it ignores the source port of
              the requesting packet and only replies to UDP  port
              137. Unfortunately, on most UNIX systems root priv­
              ilege is needed to bind to this port, and in  addi­
              tion,  if  the  <B>nmbd(8)</B>  daemon  is running on this
              machine it also binds to this port.

       <B>-A</B>     Interpret <I>name</I> as an IP Address and do a node  sta­
              tus query on this address.

       <B>-h</B>     Print a help (usage) message.
       <B>-d</B> <B>&lt;debuglevel&gt;</B>
              debuglevel is an integer from 0 to 10.

              The  default  value if this parameter is not speci­
              fied is zero.

              The higher this value,  the  more  detail  will  be
              logged  about the activities of <B>nmblookup</B>. At level
              0, only critical errors and serious  warnings  will
              be logged.

              Levels  above  1 will generate considerable amounts
              of log data, and should only be used when  investi­
              gating  a problem.  Levels above 3 are designed for
              use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of
              data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

              Note that specifying this parameter here will over­
              ride the  <I>log</I> <I>level</I> parameter in  the   <I>smb.conf(5)</I>
              file.

       <B>-s</B> <B>&lt;smb.conf&gt;</B>
              This  parameter specifies the pathname to the Samba
              configuration file,  <B>smb.conf(5)</B> This file controls
              all aspects of the Samba setup on the machine.

       <B>-i</B> <B>&lt;scope&gt;</B>
              This  specifies a NetBIOS scope that <B>nmblookup</B> will
              use to communicate  with  when  generating  NetBIOS
              names.  For  details  on the use of NetBIOS scopes,
              see rfc1001.txt and rfc1002.txt. NetBIOS scopes are
              <B>very</B>  rarely  used,  only set this parameter if you
              are the system administrator in charge of  all  the
              NetBIOS systems you communicate with.

       <B>-T</B>     This causes any IP addresses found in the lookup to
              be looked up via a reverse DNS lookup  into  a  DNS
              name, and printed out before each

              <B>IP</B> <B>address</B> <B>....</B> <B>NetBIOS</B> <B>name</B>

              pair that is the normal output.

       <B>name</B>   This  is  the NetBIOS name being queried. Depending
              upon the previous options this  may  be  a  NetBIOS
              name  or  IP  address.   If a NetBIOS name then the
              different name types may be specified by  appending
              '#&lt;type&gt;'  to  the name. This name may also be '*',
              which will return all  registered  names  within  a
              broadcast area.

<H2>AUTHOR</H2><PRE>
       The  original  Samba  software  and related utilities were
       created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by  the
       Samba  Team  as  an Open Source project similar to the way
       the Linux kernel is developed.

       The original Samba man pages were written  by  Karl  Auer.
       The  man  page  sources  were  converted  to  YODL  format
       (another excellent piece of Open Source  software,  avail­
       able           at          ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/
       &lt;URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/&gt;) and updated for the
       Samba  2.0  release  by  Jeremy Allison. The conversion to
       DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
