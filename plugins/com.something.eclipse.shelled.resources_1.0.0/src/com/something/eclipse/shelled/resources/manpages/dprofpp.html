</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <I>dprofpp</I> command interprets profile data produced by a
       profiler, such as the Devel::DProf profiler.  Dprofpp will
       read the file <I>tmon.out</I> and will display the 15 subroutines
       which are using the most time.  By default the times for
       each subroutine are given exclusive of the times of their
       child subroutines.

       To profile a Perl script run the perl interpreter with the
       <B>-d</B> switch.  So to profile script <I>test.pl</I> with Devel::DProf
       the following command should be used.

               $ perl5 -d:DProf test.pl

       Then run dprofpp to analyze the profile.  The output of
       dprofpp depends on the flags to the program and the ver­
       sion of Perl you're using.

               $ dprofpp -u
               Total Elapsed Time =    1.67 Seconds
                        User Time =    0.61 Seconds
               Exclusive Times
               %Time Seconds     #Calls sec/call Name
                52.4   0.320          2   0.1600 main::foo
                45.9   0.280        200   0.0014 main::bar
                0.00   0.000          1   0.0000 DynaLoader::import
                0.00   0.000          1   0.0000 main::baz

       The dprofpp tool can also run the profiler before analyz­
       ing the profile data.  The above two commands can be exe­
       cuted with one dprofpp command.

               $ dprofpp -u -p test.pl

       Consult "PROFILE FORMAT" in Devel::DProf for a description
       of the raw profile.


       CumulS
           Time (in seconds) spent in this routine and routines
           called from it.

       ExclSec
           Time (in seconds) spent in this routine (not including
           those called from it).

       Csec/c
           Average time (in seconds) spent in each call of this
           routine (including those called from it).


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-a</B>   Sort alphabetically by subroutine names.

       <B>-d</B>   Reverse whatever sort is used

       <B>-A</B>   Count timing for autoloaded subroutine as timing for
            *::AUTOLOAD.  Otherwise the time to autoload it is
            counted as time of the subroutine itself (there is no
            way to separate autoload time from run time).

            This is going to be irrelevant with newer Perls.
            They will inform "Devel::DProf" <I>when</I> the "AUTOLOAD"
            switches to actual subroutine, so a separate statis­
            tics for "AUTOLOAD" will be collected no matter
            whether this option is set.

       <B>-R</B>   Count anonymous subroutines defined in the same pack­
            age separately.

       <B>-E</B>   (default)  Display all subroutine times exclusive of
            child subroutine times.

       <B>-F</B>   Force the generation of fake exit timestamps if
            dprofpp reports that the profile is garbled.  This is
            only useful if dprofpp determines that the profile is
            garbled due to missing exit timestamps.  You're on
            your own if you do this.  Consult the BUGS section.

       <B>-I</B>   Display all subroutine times inclusive of child sub­
            routine times.

       <B>-l</B>   Sort by number of calls to the subroutines.  This may
            help identify candidates for inlining.

       <B>-O</B> <B>cnt</B>
            Show only <I>cnt</I> subroutines.  The default is 15.

       <B>-p</B> <B>script</B>
            Tells dprofpp that it should profile the given script

       <B>-t</B>   Display subroutine call tree to stdout.  Subroutine
            statistics are not displayed.  When a function is
            called multiple consecutive times at the same calling
            level then it is displayed once with a repeat count.

       <B>-S</B>   Display <I>merged</I> subroutine call tree to stdout.
            Statistics is displayed for each branch of the tree.

            When a function is called multiple (<I>not</I> <I>necessarily</I>
            <I>consecutive</I>) times in the same branch then all these
            calls go into one branch of the next level.  A repeat
            count is output together with combined inclusive,
            exclusive and kids time.

            Branches are sorted w.r.t. inclusive time.

       <B>-U</B>   Do not sort.  Display in the order found in the raw
            profile.

       <B>-u</B>   Display user times rather than user+system times.

       <B>-V</B>   Print dprofpp's version number and exit.  If a raw
            profile is found then its XS_VERSION variable will be
            displayed, too.

       <B>-v</B>   Sort by average time spent in subroutines during each
            call.  This may help identify candidates for inlin­
            ing.

       <B>-z</B>   (default) Sort by amount of user+system time used.
            The first few lines should show you which subroutines
            are using the most time.

       <B>-g</B> "subroutine"
            Ignore subroutines except "subroutine" and whatever
            is called from it.

       <B>-G</B> &lt;regexp&gt;
            Aggregate "Group" all calls matching the pattern
            together.  For example this can be used to group all
            calls of a set of packages

              -G "(package1::)|(package2::)|(package3::)"

            or to group subroutines by name:

              -G "getNum"

       <B>-P</B>   Used with -G to aggregate "Pull"  together all calls
            that did not match -G.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       Applications which call <B>_</B><I>exit()</I> or <I>exec()</I> from within a
       subroutine will leave an incomplete profile.  See the <B>-F</B>
       option.

       Any bugs in Devel::DProf, or any profiler generating the
       profile data, could be visible here.  See "BUGS" in
       Devel::DProf.

       Mail bug reports and feature requests to the perl5-porters
       mailing list at <I>&lt;perl5-porters@perl.org&gt;</I>.  Bug reports
       should include the output of the <B>-V</B> option.
