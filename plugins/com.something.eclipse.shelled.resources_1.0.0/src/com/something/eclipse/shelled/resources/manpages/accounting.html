<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>accounting</B> is a simple  program  to  calculate  statistics
       about  your  internet  connections  that  are  started and
       stopped by either <B>ifup</B> and <B>ifdown</B>  or  by  a  frontend  to
       <B>smpppd</B> like <B>cinternet</B> , <B>qinternet</B> or <B>kinternet.</B>

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       These  options  are  recognized  by <B>accounting</B>.  If a long
       option shows an argument as mandatory, then it  is  manda­
       tory for the equivalent short option also.

       <I>-l,</I> <I>--last=NUM</I>
              Only consider the last NUM connections.

       <I>-a,</I> <I>--after=DATE</I>

              e.g. `2002-12-24 20:15:00'.

              Note  that a date without time is treated as if the
              time is 00:00:00. Hence connections started on  the
              specified date are consider.

              Only consider connections started this month.

       <I>--last-month</I>
              Only consider connections started last month.
