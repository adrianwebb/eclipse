<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>addr2line</B> translates program addresses into file names and
       line numbers.  Given an address and an executable, it uses
       the debugging information in the executable to figure  out
       which  file  name  and  line  number are associated with a
       given address.

       The executable to use is specified  with  the  <B>-e</B>  option.
       The default is the file <I>a.out</I>.

       <B>addr2line</B> has two modes of operation.

       In  the  first, hexadecimal addresses are specified on the
       command line, and <B>addr2line</B> displays  the  file  name  and
       line number for each address.

       In  the second, <B>addr2line</B> reads hexadecimal addresses from
       standard input, and prints the file name and  line  number
       for  each  address  on  standard  output.   In  this mode,
       <B>addr2line</B> may be used in a  pipe  to  convert  dynamically
       chosen addresses.

       The  format  of  the  output is <B>FILENAME:LINENO</B>.  The file
       name and line number for each address is printed on a sep­
       arate  line.   If  the  <B>-f</B> option is used, then each <B>FILE­</B>
       <B>NAME:LINENO</B> line is preceded by a <B>FUNCTIONNAME</B> line  which
       is the name of the function containing the address.

       If  the  file name or function name can not be determined,
       <B>addr2line</B> will print two question marks  in  their  place.
       If  the  line number can not be determined, <B>addr2line</B> will
       print 0.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The long and short forms of options, shown here as  alter­
       natives, are equivalent.

       <B>-b</B> <I>bfdname</I>
       <B>--target=</B><I>bfdname</I>
           Specify  that  the  object-code  format for the object
           files is <I>bfdname</I>.

       <B>-C</B>
       <B>-f</B>
       <B>--functions</B>
           Display function names as well as file and line number
           information.

       <B>-s</B>
       <B>--basenames</B>
           Display only the base of each file name.
