       <B>patch</B> [<I>options</I>] [<I>originalfile</I> [<I>patchfile</I>]]

       but usually just

       <B>patch</B> <B>-p</B><I>num</I> <B>&lt;</B><I>patchfile</I>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>patch</B> takes a patch file <I>patchfile</I> containing a difference
       listing produced by the <B>diff</B>  program  and  applies  those
       differences  to  one  or  more  original  files, producing
       patched versions.  Normally the patched versions  are  put
       in  place  of the originals.  Backups can be made; see the
       <B>-b</B> or <B>--backup</B> option.  The  names  of  the  files  to  be
       patched  are  usually  taken  from  the patch file, but if
       there's just one file to be patched it  can  specified  on
       the command line as <I>originalfile</I>.

       Upon  startup, patch attempts to determine the type of the
       diff listing, unless overruled by  a  <B>-c</B>  (<B>--context</B>),  <B>-e</B>
       (<B>--ed</B>),  <B>-n</B> (<B>--normal</B>), or <B>-u</B> (<B>--unified</B>) option.  Context
       diffs (old-style, new-style, and unified) and normal diffs
       are  applied  by  the <B>patch</B> program itself, while <B>ed</B> diffs
       are simply fed to the <B>ed(1)</B> editor via a pipe.

       <B>patch</B> tries to skip any leading garbage, apply  the  diff,
       and  then  skip any trailing garbage.  Thus you could feed
       an article or message containing a diff listing to  <B>patch</B>,
       and  it  should work.  If the entire diff is indented by a
       consistent amount, or if a  context  diff  contains  lines
       ending  in  CRLF  or  is encapsulated one or more times by
       prepending "<B>-</B> " to lines starting with "<B>-</B>" as specified by
       Internet RFC 934, this is taken into account.

       With  context  diffs,  and  to a lesser extent with normal
       diffs, <B>patch</B> can detect when the line numbers mentioned in
       the  patch are incorrect, and attempts to find the correct
       place to apply each hunk of the patch.  As a first  guess,
       it  takes  the line number mentioned for the hunk, plus or
       minus any offset used in applying the previous  hunk.   If
       that  is  not the correct place, <B>patch</B> scans both forwards
       and backwards for a set  of  lines  matching  the  context
       given  in  the  hunk.  First <B>patch</B> looks for a place where
       all lines of the context  match.   If  no  such  place  is
       found,  and it's a context diff, and the maximum fuzz fac­
       tor is set to 1 or more, then  another  scan  takes  place
       ignoring  the  first  and  last  line of context.  If that
       fails, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to  2  or  more,
       the  first  two and last two lines of context are ignored,
       and another scan is made.  (The default maximum fuzz  fac­
       tor  is  2.)  If <B>patch</B> cannot find a place to install that
       hunk of the patch, it puts the hunk out to a reject  file,
       thought  the  hunk should go on.  If the hunk is installed
       at a different line from the line number specified in  the
       diff  you  are told the offset.  A single large offset <I>may</I>
       indicate that a hunk was installed  in  the  wrong  place.
       You  are  also  told if a fuzz factor was used to make the
       match, in which case you should also  be  slightly  suspi­
       cious.   If  the  <B>--verbose</B>  option is given, you are also
       told about hunks that match exactly.

       If no original file <I>origfile</I> is specified on  the  command
       line,  <B>patch</B>  tries to figure out from the leading garbage
       what the name of the file to edit is, using the  following
       rules.

       First, <B>patch</B> takes an ordered list of candidate file names
       as follows:

        <B>·</B> If the header is that of a context  diff,  <B>patch</B>  takes
          the  old  and  new file names in the header.  A name is
          ignored if it does not have enough slashes  to  satisfy
          the <B>-p</B><I>num</I> or <B>--strip=</B><I>num</I> option.  The name <B>/dev/null</B> is
          also ignored.

        <B>·</B> If there is an <B>Index:</B> line in the leading  garbage  and
          if  either  the old and new names are both absent or if
          <B>patch</B> is conforming to POSIX, <B>patch</B> takes the  name  in
          the <B>Index:</B> line.

        <B>·</B> For  the  purpose of the following rules, the candidate
          file names are considered to be in the order (old, new,
          index), regardless of the order that they appear in the
          header.

       Then <B>patch</B> selects a file name from the candidate list  as
       follows:

        <B>·</B> If  some  of  the  named files exist, <B>patch</B> selects the
          first name if conforming to POSIX, and  the  best  name
          otherwise.

        <B>·</B> If  <B>patch</B> is not ignoring RCS, ClearCase, and SCCS (see
          the <B>-g</B> <I>num</I> or <B>--get=</B><I>num</I> option),  and  no  named  files
          exist  but  an RCS, ClearCase, or SCCS master is found,
          <B>patch</B>  selects  the  first  named  file  with  an  RCS,
          ClearCase, or SCCS master.

        <B>·</B> If  no  named  files  exist, no RCS, ClearCase, or SCCS
          master was found, some names are given,  <B>patch</B>  is  not
          conforming  to POSIX, and the patch appears to create a
          file, <B>patch</B> selects the best name  requiring  the  cre­
          ation of the fewest directories.

       for confirmation before proceeding.

       The  upshot of all this is that you should be able to say,
       while in a news interface, something like the following:

          <B>|</B> <B>patch</B> <B>-d</B> <B>/usr/src/local/blurfl</B>

       and patch a file in the <B>blurfl</B> directory directly from the
       article containing the patch.

       If  the  patch  file  contains  more than one patch, <B>patch</B>
       tries to apply each of them as if they came from  separate
       patch  files.   This means, among other things, that it is
       assumed that the name of the file to patch must be  deter­
       mined  for  each diff listing, and that the garbage before
       each diff listing contains interesting things such as file
       names and revision level, as mentioned previously.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-b</B>  or  <B>--backup</B>
          Make  backup  files.   That  is,  when patching a file,
          rename or copy the original  instead  of  removing  it.
          When  backing  up a file that does not exist, an empty,
          unreadable backup file is created as a  placeholder  to
          represent  the  nonexistent file.  See the <B>-V</B> or <B>--ver­</B>
          <B>sion-control</B> option for details about how  backup  file
          names are determined.

       <B>--backup-if-mismatch</B>
          Back  up  a  file  if the patch does not match the file
          exactly and if backups  are  not  otherwise  requested.
          This  is  the  default  unless  <B>patch</B>  is conforming to
          POSIX.

       <B>--no-backup-if-mismatch</B>
          Do not back up a file if the patch does not  match  the
          file   exactly   and   if  backups  are  not  otherwise
          requested.  This is the default if <B>patch</B> is  conforming
          to POSIX.

       <B>-B</B> <I>pref</I>  or  <B>--prefix=</B><I>pref</I>
          Prefix  <I>pref</I>  to a file name when generating its simple
          backup file name.  For example, with <B>-B</B> <B>/junk/</B> the sim­
          ple   backup   file   name   for   <B>src/patch/util.c</B>  is
          <B>/junk/src/patch/util.c</B>.

       <B>--binary</B>
          Read and write all files in  binary  mode,  except  for
          standard  output  and  <B>/dev/tty</B>.   This  option  has no
          effect on POSIX-conforming systems.   On  systems  like
          DOS  where  this  option  makes a difference, the patch
          should be generated by <B>diff</B> <B>-a</B> <B>--binary</B>.
          ally changing any files.

       <B>-e</B>  or  <B>--ed</B>
          Interpret the patch file as an <B>ed</B> script.

       <B>-E</B>  or  <B>--remove-empty-files</B>
          Remove  output  files  that are empty after the patches
          have been applied.  Normally this  option  is  unneces­
          sary,  since  <B>patch</B>  can examine the time stamps on the
          header to determine whether a file should  exist  after
          patching.   However, if the input is not a context diff
          or if <B>patch</B> is conforming  to  POSIX,  <B>patch</B>  does  not
          remove empty patched files unless this option is given.
          When <B>patch</B> removes a file, it also attempts  to  remove
          any empty ancestor directories.

       <B>-f</B>  or  <B>--force</B>
          Assume  that  the  user knows exactly what he or she is
          doing, and do not  ask  any  questions.   Skip  patches
          whose  headers  do not say which file is to be patched;
          patch files even though they have the wrong version for
          the  <B>Prereq:</B> line in the patch; and assume that patches
          are not reversed even if they look like they are.  This
          option does not suppress commentary; use <B>-s</B> for that.

       <B>-F</B> <I>num</I>  or  <B>--fuzz=</B><I>num</I>
          Set  the maximum fuzz factor.  This option only applies
          to diffs that have context, and causes <B>patch</B> to  ignore
          up  to that many lines in looking for places to install
          a hunk.  Note that a larger fuzz factor  increases  the
          odds  of a faulty patch.  The default fuzz factor is 2,
          and it may not be set to more than the number of  lines
          of context in the context diff, ordinarily 3.

       <B>-g</B> <I>num</I>  or  <B>--get=</B><I>num</I>
          This  option  controls  <B>patch</B>'s  actions when a file is
          under RCS or SCCS control, and does  not  exist  or  is
          read-only  and  matches  the default version, or when a
          file is under ClearCase control and does not exist.  If
          <I>num</I>  is  positive,  <B>patch</B> gets (or checks out) the file
          from  the  revision  control  system;  if  zero,  <B>patch</B>
          ignores  RCS,  ClearCase, and SCCS and does not get the
          file; and if negative, <B>patch</B> asks the user  whether  to
          get  the  file.   The  default  value of this option is
          given by the value of the <B>PATCH_GET</B>  environment  vari­
          able if it is set; if not, the default value is zero if
          <B>patch</B> is conforming to POSIX, negative otherwise.

       <B>--help</B>
          Print a summary of options and exit.

       <B>-i</B> <I>patchfile</I>  or  <B>--input=</B><I>patchfile</I>

       <B>-N</B>  or  <B>--forward</B>
          Ignore  patches  that  seem  to  be reversed or already
          applied.  See also <B>-R</B>.

       <B>-o</B> <I>outfile</I>  or  <B>--output=</B><I>outfile</I>
          Send output to <I>outfile</I> instead  of  patching  files  in
          place.

       <B>-p</B><I>num</I>  or  <B>--strip=</B><I>num</I>
          Strip   the  smallest  prefix  containing  <I>num</I>  leading
          slashes from each file name found in the patch file.  A
          sequence  of one or more adjacent slashes is counted as
          a single slash.  This controls how file names found  in
          the patch file are treated, in case you keep your files
          in a different directory than the person who  sent  out
          the patch.  For example, supposing the file name in the
          patch file was

             <B>/u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c</B>

          setting <B>-p0</B> gives the entire file name unmodified,  <B>-p1</B>
          gives

             <B>u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c</B>

          without the leading slash, <B>-p4</B> gives

             <B>blurfl/blurfl.c</B>

          and  not  specifying <B>-p</B> at all just gives you <B>blurfl.c</B>.
          Whatever you end up with is looked for  either  in  the
          current directory, or the directory specified by the <B>-d</B>
          option.

       <B>--posix</B>
          Conform more strictly to the POSIX  standard,  as  fol­
          lows.

           <B>·</B> Take  the  first  existing  file from the list (old,
             new, index) when  intuiting  file  names  from  diff
             headers.

           <B>·</B> Do not remove files that are empty after patching.

           <B>·</B> Do not ask whether to get files from RCS, ClearCase,
             or SCCS.

           <B>·</B> Require that all options precede the  files  in  the
             command line.

           <B>·</B> Do not backup files when there is a mismatch.

          <B>c</B>      Quote names as for a C language string.

          <B>escape</B> Quote as with <B>c</B> except omit the surrounding dou­
                 ble-quote characters.

          You can  specify  the  default  value  of  the  <B>--quot­</B>
          <B>ing-style</B>  option  with  the environment variable <B>QUOT­</B>
          <B>ING_STYLE</B>.  If that environment variable  is  not  set,
          the default value is <B>shell</B>.

       <B>-r</B> <I>rejectfile</I>  or  <B>--reject-file=</B><I>rejectfile</I>
          Put rejects into <I>rejectfile</I> instead of the default <B>.rej</B>
          file.

       <B>-R</B>  or  <B>--reverse</B>
          Assume that this patch was created with the old and new
          files swapped.  (Yes, I'm afraid that does happen occa­
          sionally,  human  nature  being  what  it  is.)   <B>patch</B>
          attempts  to  swap each hunk around before applying it.
          Rejects come out in the swapped format.  The <B>-R</B>  option
          does not work with <B>ed</B> diff scripts because there is too
          little information to reconstruct  the  reverse  opera­
          tion.

          If  the first hunk of a patch fails, <B>patch</B> reverses the
          hunk to see if it can be applied that way.  If it  can,
          you  are  asked  if you want to have the <B>-R</B> option set.
          If it can't, the patch continues  to  be  applied  nor­
          mally.   (Note:  this  method  cannot detect a reversed
          patch if it is a normal diff and if the  first  command
          is  an append (i.e. it should have been a delete) since
          appends always succeed, due to the  fact  that  a  null
          context matches anywhere.  Luckily, most patches add or
          change lines rather than delete them, so most  reversed
          normal diffs begin with a delete, which fails, trigger­
          ing the heuristic.)

       <B>-s</B>  or  <B>--silent</B>  or  <B>--quiet</B>
          Work silently, unless an error occurs.

       <B>-t</B>  or  <B>--batch</B>
          Suppress questions like <B>-f</B>,  but  make  some  different
          assumptions:  skip patches whose headers do not contain
          file names (the same as <B>-f</B>); skip patches for which the
          file  has the wrong version for the <B>Prereq:</B> line in the
          patch; and assume that patches  are  reversed  if  they
          look like they are.

       <B>-T</B>  or  <B>--set-time</B>
          Set  the modification and access times of patched files
          from time stamps given in context diff headers,  assum­
          exit.

       <B>-V</B> <I>method</I>  or  <B>--version-control=</B><I>method</I>
          Use  <I>method</I> to determine backup file names.  The method
          can also be given by the <B>PATCH_VERSION_CONTROL</B> (or,  if
          that's  not set, the <B>VERSION_CONTROL</B>) environment vari­
          able, which is overridden by this option.   The  method
          does  not  affect  whether  backup  files  are made; it
          affects only the names of any  backup  files  that  are
          made.

          The value of <I>method</I> is like the GNU Emacs `version-con­
          trol' variable; <B>patch</B> also recognizes synonyms that are
          more  descriptive.   The  valid  values  for <I>method</I> are
          (unique abbreviations are accepted):

          <B>existing</B>  or  <B>nil</B>
             Make numbered backups of  files  that  already  have
             them,   otherwise   simple  backups.   This  is  the
             default.

          <B>numbered</B>  or  <B>t</B>
             Make numbered backups.   The  numbered  backup  file
             name for <I>F</I> is <I>F</I><B>.~</B><I>N</I><B>~</B> where <I>N</I> is the version number.

          <B>simple</B>  or  <B>never</B>
             Make  simple  backups.   The  <B>-B</B>  or <B>--prefix</B>, <B>-Y</B> or
             <B>--basename-prefix</B>, and <B>-z</B> or <B>--suffix</B> options  spec­
             ify  the  simple backup file name.  If none of these
             options are given, then a simple  backup  suffix  is
             used;  it  is  the value of the <B>SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX</B>
             environment variable if set, and is <B>.orig</B> otherwise.

          With  numbered  or  simple  backups, if the backup file
          name is too long, the backup suffix <B>~</B> is used  instead;
          if  even appending <B>~</B> would make the name too long, then
          <B>~</B> replaces the last character of the file name.

       <B>--verbose</B>
          Output extra information about the work being done.

       <B>-x</B> <I>num</I>  or  <B>--debug=</B><I>num</I>
          Set internal debugging flags of interest only to  <B>patch</B>
          patchers.

       <B>-Y</B> <I>pref</I>  or  <B>--basename-prefix=</B><I>pref</I>
          Prefix  <I>pref</I> to the basename of a file name when gener­
          ating its simple backup file name.  For  example,  with
          <B>-Y</B> <B>.del/</B>    the    simple    backup   file   name   for
          <B>src/patch/util.c</B> is <B>src/patch/.del/util.c</B>.

       <B>-z</B> <I>suffix</I>  or  <B>--suffix=</B><I>suffix</I>
          The  <B>-Z</B>  or <B>--set-utc</B> and <B>-T</B> or <B>--set-time</B> options nor­
          mally refrain from setting a file's time if the  file's
          original  time  does  not  match  the time given in the
          patch header, or if its contents do not match the patch
          exactly.   However,  if  the  <B>-f</B>  or  <B>--force</B> option is
          given, the file time is set regardless.

          Due to the limitations of  <B>diff</B>  output  format,  these
          options cannot update the times of files whose contents
          have not changed.  Also, if you use these options,  you
          should  remove  (e.g.  with  <B>make</B> <B>clean</B>) all files that
          depend on the patched files, so that later  invocations
          of  <B>make</B>  do  not  get  confused  by the patched files'
          times.


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
       <B>PATCH_GET</B>
          This specifies whether <B>patch</B> gets missing or  read-only
          files  from RCS, ClearCase, or SCCS by default; see the
          <B>-g</B> or <B>--get</B> option.

       <B>POSIXLY_CORRECT</B>
          If set, <B>patch</B> conforms more strictly to the POSIX stan­
          dard by default: see the <B>--posix</B> option.

       <B>QUOTING_STYLE</B>
          Default value of the <B>--quoting-style</B> option.

       <B>SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX</B>
          Extension  to  use for simple backup file names instead
          of <B>.orig</B>.

       <B>TMPDIR</B>, <B>TMP</B>, <B>TEMP</B>
          Directory to put temporary files  in;  <B>patch</B>  uses  the
          first  environment  variable  in this list that is set.
          If none are set, the default is system-dependent; it is
          normally <B>/tmp</B> on Unix hosts.

       <B>VERSION_CONTROL</B> or <B>PATCH_VERSION_CONTROL</B>
          Selects  version  control  style;  see the <B>-v</B> or <B>--ver­</B>
          <B>sion-control</B> option.


</PRE>
<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>
       <I>$TMPDIR</I><B>/p*</B>
          temporary files

       <B>/dev/tty</B>
          controlling terminal; used to get answers to  questions
          asked of the user


</PRE>
<H2>SEE ALSO</H2><PRE>
       <B>diff(1)</B>, <B>ed(1)</B>
       Unix  format,  so  that patch recipients can use the <B>-Z</B> or
       <B>--set-utc</B> option.   Here  is  an  example  command,  using
       Bourne shell syntax:

          <B>LC_ALL=C</B> <B>TZ=UTC0</B> <B>diff</B> <B>-Naur</B> <B>gcc-2.7</B> <B>gcc-2.8</B>

       Tell  your  recipients  how  to apply the patch by telling
       them which directory to <B>cd</B> to, and which <B>patch</B> options  to
       use.   The  option  string <B>-Np1</B> is recommended.  Test your
       procedure by pretending to be  a  recipient  and  applying
       your patch to a copy of the original files.

       You  can  save  people  a lot of grief by keeping a <B>patch­</B>
       <B>level.h</B> file which is patched to increment the patch level
       as  the first diff in the patch file you send out.  If you
       put a <B>Prereq:</B> line in with the patch, it  won't  let  them
       apply patches out of order without some warning.

       You  can create a file by sending out a diff that compares
       <B>/dev/null</B> or an empty file  dated  the  Epoch  (1970-01-01
       00:00:00  UTC)  to the file you want to create.  This only
       works if the file you want to create doesn't exist already
       in  the  target  directory.   Conversely, you can remove a
       file by sending out a context diff that compares the  file
       to  be  deleted  with  an empty file dated the Epoch.  The
       file will be removed unless <B>patch</B> is conforming  to  POSIX
       and  the  <B>-E</B>  or <B>--remove-empty-files</B> option is not given.
       An easy way to generate patches  that  create  and  remove
       files is to use GNU <B>diff</B>'s <B>-N</B> or <B>--new-file</B> option.

       If the recipient is supposed to use the <B>-p</B><I>N</I> option, do not
       send output that looks like this:

          <B>diff</B> <B>-Naur</B> <B>v2.0.29/prog/README</B> <B>prog/README</B>
          <B>---</B> <B>v2.0.29/prog/README</B>   <B>Mon</B> <B>Mar</B> <B>10</B> <B>15:13:12</B> <B>1997</B>
          <B>+++</B> <B>prog/README</B>   <B>Mon</B> <B>Mar</B> <B>17</B> <B>14:58:22</B> <B>1997</B>

       because the two  file  names  have  different  numbers  of
       slashes,  and  different  versions  of <B>patch</B> interpret the
       file names differently.  To avoid confusion,  send  output
       that looks like this instead:

          <B>diff</B> <B>-Naur</B> <B>v2.0.29/prog/README</B> <B>v2.0.30/prog/README</B>
          <B>---</B> <B>v2.0.29/prog/README</B>   <B>Mon</B> <B>Mar</B> <B>10</B> <B>15:13:12</B> <B>1997</B>
          <B>+++</B> <B>v2.0.30/prog/README</B>   <B>Mon</B> <B>Mar</B> <B>17</B> <B>14:58:22</B> <B>1997</B>


       Avoid  sending patches that compare backup file names like
       <B>README.orig</B>, since this might confuse <B>patch</B> into  patching
       a  backup  file  instead  of the real file.  Instead, send
       patches that compare the same base file names in different
       directories, e.g. <B>old/README</B> and <B>new/README</B>.
       listings into one file, it may be wiser to  group  related
       patches  into  separate  files in case something goes hay­
       wire.


</PRE>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
       Diagnostics generally indicate that <B>patch</B>  couldn't  parse
       your patch file.

       If the <B>--verbose</B> option is given, the message <B>Hmm...</B> indi­
       cates that there is unprocessed text in the patch file and
       that  <B>patch</B>  is  attempting  to  intuit whether there is a
       patch in that text and, if so, what kind of patch it is.

       <B>patch</B>'s exit status is 0 if all hunks are applied success­
       fully,  1  if some hunks cannot be applied, and 2 if there
       is more serious trouble.  When applying a set  of  patches
       in a loop it behooves you to check this exit status so you
       don't apply a later patch to a partially patched file.


</PRE>
<H2>CAVEATS</H2><PRE>
       Context diffs cannot reliably represent  the  creation  or
       deletion  of  empty  files,  empty directories, or special
       files such as symbolic  links.   Nor  can  they  represent
       changes  to  file metadata like ownership, permissions, or
       whether one file is a hard link to  another.   If  changes
       like  these are also required, separate instructions (e.g.
       a shell script) to accomplish them  should  accompany  the
       patch.

       <B>patch</B>  cannot  tell  if  the line numbers are off in an <B>ed</B>
       script, and can detect bad line numbers in a  normal  diff
       only  when  it finds a change or deletion.  A context diff
       using fuzz factor 3 may have the same  problem.   Until  a
       suitable interactive interface is added, you should proba­
       bly do a context diff in these cases to see if the changes
       made  sense.   Of  course,  compiling  without errors is a
       pretty good indication that  the  patch  worked,  but  not
       always.

       <B>patch</B>  usually  produces the correct results, even when it
       has to do a lot of guessing.   However,  the  results  are
       guaranteed to be correct only when the patch is applied to
       exactly the same version of the file that  the  patch  was
       generated from.


</PRE>
<H2>COMPATIBILITY ISSUES</H2><PRE>
       The  POSIX  standard  specifies behavior that differs from
       <B>patch</B>'s traditional behavior.   You  should  be  aware  of
       these differences if you must interoperate with <B>patch</B> ver­
       sions 2.1 and earlier, which do not conform to POSIX.

        <B>·</B> In traditional  <B>patch</B>,  the  <B>-p</B>  option's  operand  was
          option.

          Conversely,  in  POSIX  <B>patch</B>,  backups are never made,
          even when there is a  mismatch.   In  GNU  <B>patch</B>,  this
          behavior  is  enabled  with the <B>--no-backup-if-mismatch</B>
          option, or by conforming  to  POSIX  with  the  <B>--posix</B>
          option  or  by  setting the <B>POSIXLY_CORRECT</B> environment
          variable.

          The <B>-b</B> <I>suffix</I> option of traditional <B>patch</B> is equivalent
          to the <B>-b</B> <B>-z</B> <I>suffix</I> options of GNU <B>patch</B>.

        <B>·</B> Traditional  <B>patch</B> used a complicated (and incompletely
          documented) method to intuit the name of the file to be
          patched  from  the  patch  header.  This method did not
          conform to POSIX, and had a  few  gotchas.   Now  <B>patch</B>
          uses a different, equally complicated (but better docu­
          mented) method that is optionally POSIX-conforming;  we
          hope it has fewer gotchas.  The two methods are compat­
          ible if the file names in the context diff  header  and
          the  <B>Index:</B>  line are all identical after prefix-strip­
          ping.   Your  patch  is  normally  compatible  if  each
          header's  file  names  all  contain  the same number of
          slashes.

        <B>·</B> When traditional <B>patch</B> asked the user  a  question,  it
          sent  the  question to standard error and looked for an
          answer from the first file in the following  list  that
          was   a  terminal:  standard  error,  standard  output,
          <B>/dev/tty</B>, and standard input.  Now  <B>patch</B>  sends  ques­
          tions   to   standard  output  and  gets  answers  from
          <B>/dev/tty</B>.  Defaults for some answers have been  changed
          so  that  <B>patch</B>  never  goes into an infinite loop when
          using default answers.

        <B>·</B> Traditional <B>patch</B>  exited  with  a  status  value  that
          counted  the  number  of bad hunks, or with status 1 if
          there was real trouble.  Now <B>patch</B> exits with status  1
          if some hunks failed, or with 2 if there was real trou­
          ble.

        <B>·</B> Limit yourself to the following  options  when  sending
          instructions meant to be executed by anyone running GNU
          <B>patch</B>, traditional <B>patch</B>, or a <B>patch</B> that  conforms  to
          POSIX.   Spaces  are significant in the following list,
          and operands are required.

             <B>-c</B>
             <B>-d</B> <I>dir</I>
             <B>-D</B> <I>define</I>
             <B>-e</B>
             <B>-l</B>

       If code has been duplicated (for instance with <B>#ifdef</B> <B>OLD­</B>
       <B>CODE</B> ... <B>#else</B> <B>...</B> <B>#endif</B>), <B>patch</B> is incapable of patching
       both versions, and, if it works at all, will likely  patch
       the wrong one, and tell you that it succeeded to boot.

       If  you apply a patch you've already applied, <B>patch</B> thinks
       it is a reversed patch, and offers to un-apply the  patch.
       This could be construed as a feature.
