<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  <B>umount</B>  command detaches the file system(s) mentioned
       from the file hierarchy.  A file system  is  specified  by
       giving the directory where it has been mounted. Giving the
       special device on which the file  system  lives  may  also
       work, but is obsolete, mainly because it will fail in case
       this device was mounted on more than one directory.

       Note that a file system cannot be  unmounted  when  it  is
       `busy'  - for example, when there are open files on it, or
       when some process has its working directory there, or when
       a  swap file on it is in use.  The offending process could
       even be <B>umount</B> itself - it opens libc,  and  libc  in  its
       turn  may  open  for example locale files.  A lazy unmount
       avoids this problem.

       Options for the <B>umount</B> command:

       <B>-V</B>     Print version and exit.

       <B>-h</B>     Print help message and exit.

       <B>-v</B>     Verbose mode.

       <B>-n</B>     Unmount without writing in <I>/etc/mtab</I>.

       <B>-r</B>     In case unmounting fails, try to remount read-only.

       <B>-d</B>     In  case  the  unmounted  device was a loop device,
              also free this loop device.

       <B>-a</B>     All of the file systems described in <I>/etc/mtab</I>  are
              unmounted.  (With <B>umount</B> version 2.7 and later: the
              <I>proc</I> filesystem is not unmounted.)

       <B>-t</B> <I>vfstype</I>
              Indicate that the actions should only be  taken  on
              file  systems of the specified type.  More than one
              type may be specified in a  comma  separated  list.
              The  list of file system types can be prefixed with
              <B>no</B> to specify the file system  types  on  which  no
              action should be taken.

       <B>-O</B> <I>options</I>
              Indicate  that  the actions should only be taken on
              file  systems  with  the   specified   options   in


</PRE>
<H2>THE LOOP DEVICE</H2><PRE>
       The <B>umount</B> command will free  the  loop  device  (if  any)
       associated  with  the  mount,  in case it finds the option
       `loop=...' in <I>/etc/mtab</I>, or when the -d option was  given.
       Any  pending loop devices can be freed using `losetup -d',
       see <B>losetup(8)</B>.
