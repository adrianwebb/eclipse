       This   manpage   has  been  automatically  generated  from
       mtools's texinfo documentation, and may  not  be  entirely

<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       The mpartition command is used to create  MS-DOS  filesys­
       tems  as  partitions.  This is intended to be used on non-
       Linux systems, i.e. systems where fdisk and easy access to
       Scsi  devices  are not available.  This command only works
       on drives whose partition variable is set.

       mpartition -p <I>drive</I>
       mpartition -r <I>drive</I>
       mpartition -I [-B <I>bootSector</I>] <I>drive</I>
       mpartition -a <I>drive</I>
       mpartition -d <I>drive</I>
       mpartition -c [-s <I>sectors</I>] [-h <I>heads</I>]
       [-t <I>cylinders</I>] [-v [-T <I>type</I>] [-b
       <I>begin</I>] [-l length] [-f]



       Mpartition supports the following operations:

       p      Prints a command line to recreate the partition for
              the drive.  Nothing is printed if the partition for
              the drive is not defined, or an  inconsistency  has
              been detected.  If verbose (-v) is also set, prints
              the current partition table.

       r      Removes the partition described by <I>drive</I>.

       I      Initializes the partition table,  and  removes  all
              partitions.

       c      Creates the partition described by <I>drive</I>.

       a      "Activates"  the partition, i.e. makes it bootable.
              Only one partition can be bootable at a time.

       d      "Desactivates"  the  partition,   i.e.   makes   it
              unbootable.

       If  no  operation  is  given,  the  current  settings  are
       printed.

       For partition creations, the following options are  avail­
       t <I>cylinders</I>
              The number of cylinders of the partition  (not  the
              number of cylinders of the whole drive.

       b <I>begin</I>
              The  starting offset of the partition, expressed in
              sectors. If begin is not given, mpartition lets the
              partition begin at the start of the disk (partition
              number 1), or immediately after the end of the pre­
              vious partition.

       l <I>length</I>
              The  size  (length)  of the partition, expressed in
              sectors.  If end is not given,  mpartition  figures
              out  the size from the number of sectors, heads and
              cylinders.  If these are not given either, it gives
              the  partition the biggest possible size, consider­
              ing disk size and start of the next partition.

       The following option is available for all operation  which
       modify the partition table:

       f      Usually,  before  writing  back  any changes to the
              partition, mpartition performs certain  consistenct
              checks,  such  as  checking for overlaps and proper
              alignment of  the  partitions.   If  any  of  these
              checks  fails,  the partition table is not changes.
              The -f allows you to override these safeguards.

       The following options are available for all operations:

       v      Together with -p prints the partition table  as  it
              is  now (no change operation), or as it is after it
              is modified.

       vv     If the verbosity flag is  given  twice,  mpartition
              will  print  out  a  hexdump of the partition table
              when reading it from and writing it to the  device.

       The following option is available for partition table ini­
       tialization:

       B <I>bootSector</I>
              Reads the template master  boot  record  from  file
              <I>bootSector</I>.

       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.
       Indeed, in the info version certain examples are difficult
       to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
