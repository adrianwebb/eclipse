<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>flea</B>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>flea</B>  is  a  shell  script which helps you to submit a bug
       report against the <B>mutt(1)</B> mail user agent.

       If you invoke <B>flea</B>, you'll first be prompted for  a  short
       description  of  the problem you experience.  This will be
       used as the bug report's subject line,  so  it  should  be
       concise, but informative.

       You  are then asked to assign an initial severity level to
       the problem you observe; <B>flea</B> will give you a  description
       which severity level is appropriate or not.

       Then,  you are asked for the location of a core dump (nor­
       mally named <B>core</B>) which may have been left over by a crash
       of  your <B>mutt(1)</B>.  You can just type "no" here, or you can
       enter the path leading to a core dump.  <B>flea</B> will  try  to
       use  either  <B>sdb(1)</B>,  <B>dbx(1)</B>,  or  <B>gdb(1)</B>  to extract some
       information from this core dump which may  be  helpful  to
       developers in order to determine the reason for the crash.

       Finally, you are asked whether or not you want to  include
       personal  and  system <B>mutt(1)</B> configuration files with the
       bug report.  If at all possible, we  urge  you  to  answer
       these  questions  with "yes", since a reference configura­
       tion makes it incredibly easier to track down a problem.

       If you are using Debian GNU/Linux,  <B>flea</B>  will  now  check
       whether or not <B>mutt</B> has been installed as a Debian package
       on your system, and suggest to file the  bug  against  the
       <B>mutt(1)</B>  and Debian bug tracking systems.  This option was
       added since the <B>mutt(1)</B> project uses another instantiation
       of  the  Debian  bug  tracking  system, so submitting bugs
       against both systems in one pass is simple.

       You are then dropped into your favorite editor  as  deter­
       mined by the <B>EDITOR</B> and <B>VISUAL</B> environment variables.

       Please  give  us  details  about  the problem in the empty
       space below the line  reading  "Please  type  your  report
       below  this  line".   We  are  most  interested in precise
       information on what symptoms you observe  and  what  steps
       may  be used to reproduce the bug.  Chances are that prob­
       lems which can easily be reproduced will be fixed quickly.
       So please take some time when filling out this part of the
       template.

       The remainder of the template contains  various  kinds  of
       information gathered from your system, including output of
       on: Once your bug report has been  entered  into  the  bug
       tracking  system, it will be assigned a unique serial num­
       ber about which you are informed via e-mail.  If you  wish
       to  submit  additional  information about the bug, you can
       just send it to the address <I>serial</I><B>@bugs.guug.de</B>.

       Later, you will most likely  receive  questions  from  the
       developers  about  the  problem you observed, and you will
       eventually be informed  that  your  bug  report  has  been
       closed.   This  means that the bug has been fixed at least
       in the <B>cvs(1)</B> repository.   If  the  answers  you  receive
       don't  satisfy you, don't hesitate to contact the develop­
       ers directly under <B>mutt-dev@mutt.org.</B>

       You can also browse your bug  report  and  all  additional
       information  and  replies  connected  to  it using the bug
       tracking system's Web interface under the  following  URL:
       http://bugs.guug.de/
